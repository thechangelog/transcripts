**Mat Ryer:** Hello, and welcome to Go Time. I'm Mat Ryer, and today we're playing a very special game. This is Gophers Say, a game show all about the opinions of our lovely Go Time listeners. This is Go Time's 200th episode. 200th... Try saying that; it's a difficult word to say, 200th... You know, because of the -d-, and the -th, -dth... It's weird. \[laughter\] Well, we of course for our 200th celebration had to welcome back the Go Time OG hosts... Brian Ketelsen's here. Hello, Brian!

**Brian Ketelsen:** Hello, Brian!

**Mat Ryer:** \[laughs\] Carlisia Thompson is also with us. Carlisia...?

**Carlisia Thompson:** Hi, everybody. Glad to be here!

**Mat Ryer:** Glad you are here. Erik St. Martin is also here, aren't you, Erik?

**Erik St. Martin:** Hey, everybody!

**Mat Ryer:** Welcome, Erik. It's great to have you back. And we're also joined by some present day hosts that you may have seen knocking about... Natalie Pistunovich is here... Hello, Natalie.

**Natalie Pistunovich:** Hello, everyone.

**Mat Ryer:** Welcome. Kris Brandow is also here. Hello, Kris.

**Kris Brandow:** Hello!

**Mat Ryer:** Welcome to the game show. We've also got Angelica Hill. Hello, Angelica.

**Angelica Hill:** \[00:04:04.05\] Hello!

**Mat Ryer:** \[singing\] Angelicaaa...! Does everyone sing your name if they've seen Hamilton now?

**Angelica Hill:** They do, yes. And I then respond and make them very uncomfortable.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, you harmonize with them straight away. That's good.

**Angelica Hill:** Yeah. I just go "Alyzah...!" And they're like, "Oh, God..." That was a bit off-tune... \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** No, no, it's brilliant. We'll fix it. We've got voice pitch fix. Mark can do it; he's a music producer now.

**Erik St. Martin:** We're auto-tuning, everybody.

**Mat Ryer:** Exactly. \[laughter\] We've also got Johnny Boursiquot here though... Hello, Johnny Boursiquot!

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Hello! Yes, mate, I'm here, knocking about...

**Mat Ryer:** You certainly are. I appreciate the accent, because I can understand you, at last... \[laughter\]

**Angelica Hill:** Really? It just breaks my heart...

**Mark Bates:** That was pretty bad, Johnny...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I know, I know...

**Angelica Hill:** I've heard you do better, Johnny...

**Mat Ryer:** Oh no, don't troll Johnny. He's one of the nicest --

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I came to have fun.

**Mat Ryer:** Johnny's the nicest one on here. We can't have a go at him. \[laughter\] And last but not least -- what?! It is least... It's Mark Bates. Hello, Mr. Bates. Welcome back.

**Mark Bates:** Hello, everyone.

**Mat Ryer:** Yes...

**Mark Bates:** I'mma do my \[unintelligible 00:05:04.21\] sandwich I can do really, really well, but every other word is a swear, so I don't think that would be appropriate... \[unintelligible 00:05:12.07\]

**Mat Ryer:** Let me tell you about Gophers Say. Gophers Say is like family feud. Or in the U.K. it's called Family Fortunes, which is actually much nicer, I think. It's a bit like how we have The Great British Bake Off, which is like everyone's all nice and they help each other... And then you have the U.S. Master Chef, where they're like "I will destroy! I'm gonna make a souffl√©. You will be wiped from the face of the Earth!"

**Kris Brandow:** Talking about bad accents... Geez.

**Mark Bates:** He's been practicing that bit all week, too; it's just really sad that --

**Erik St. Martin:** You should have done Ramsey...

**Mat Ryer:** "You burned the effin' risotto! It's raw!" \[laughter\]

**Mark Bates:** Okay, I think we should all try not to do accents anymore, because so far they've all been terrible...

**Erik St. Martin:** I admit, I'm terrible at accents...

**Carlisia Thompson:** Wait, wait, wait... If we're not gonna do accents, what am I gonna do? \[laughter\]

**Mark Bates:** Oh, we should really move on...

**Mat Ryer:** We asked a hundred Gophers a set of questions, and it's your job to find the most common answers. It's not a game of right or wrong, this is about getting into the horrible little minds that we've surveyed of those Gophers, and figuring out what they would have said.

**Angelica Hill:** If you're my team, you'd better think that it's about getting it right... \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Ooh...! Competitive.

**Angelica Hill:** It's all I'm saying.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Always Be Winning. That's Carlisia.

**Brian Ketelsen:** Knights are out!

**Mat Ryer:** You're gonna be split into two teams, which we'll do in a moment, and we're gonna Round Robin asking you to try and guess the most common answers, without conferring. So for example, if the question is "What's your favorite programming language?", you might say "Go", and if people agree with you, you'll hear this sound. \[win alert\] If 95 people agree with you, you get 95 points. So that's pretty good. If you said - I don't know, "Java", you might hear this sound. \[fail sound\] And that means nobody agrees, and unfortunately, you'll receive \[unintelligible 00:07:22.28\] which is French for "no points", and you lose a life. If your team loses three lives, then the other team has the chance to steal the round, and you will be allowed to confer when it comes to stealing. You actually only have to get anything on the board to steal... So be careful of those steals. I'll try to make that my catchphrase for this. So does everyone understand the rules?

**Carlisia Thompson:** No. Let's do it.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, me neither.

**Erik St. Martin:** You ask questions, we try to get them right. Boom.

**Mark Bates:** Yeah, something like that. If you've ever sat in a dentist's waiting room, you've seen the show. \[laughter\]

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Really? What kind of dentist do you go to?

**Mark Bates:** \[00:08:00.11\] Apparently, one that likes Steve Harvey, and likes to show nothing but Steve Harvey's version of Family Feud all day long...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Okay.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, he only goes to comedy-like TV-related dentists, which is why all his teeth are hilarious. Okay, so I'm gonna quickly go around and we're gonna meet our contestants here. I'm gonna ask for your Twitter name in case people want to follow you... And I've tried to come up with some questions to sort of probe deep; we're gonna see if we can learn a bit about it.

Brian, let's start with you. What's your Twitter name, Brian?

**Brian Ketelsen:** It's @bketelsen.

**Mat Ryer:** I see. How are you spelling Ketelsen, mate?

**Brian Ketelsen:** The Norwegian way, K-E-T-E-L-S-E-N.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, thank you so much. And your question, I thought - Brian, what's your favorite URL scheme? HTPPS? FTP? Which one do you reckon?

**Brian Ketelsen:** I like Gopher.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, what an answer, Brian... \[laughter\]

**Mark Bates:** That is an old school--

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Old school.

**Carlisia Thompson:** That's clever.

**Brian Ketelsen:** Thank you.

**Mat Ryer:** Excellent. It's clever, isn't it, Carlisia?

**Carlisia Thompson:** Anyone who understood what he said, just consider yourself very old. \[laughter\]

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Already there.

**Mat Ryer:** I didn't understand it, by the way, but I was just playing along.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Right, right.

**Mat Ryer:** Carlisia, what's your Twitter name, in case people want to follow you?

**Carlisia Thompson:** It's my first name.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. How are you spelling that?

**Carlisia Thompson:** \[laughs\]

**Mark Bates:** I-T-S-M-Y...

**Mat Ryer:** That'd be good...

**Carlisia Thompson:** C-A-R-L-I-S-I-A.

**Mat Ryer:** Excellent. And what's your favorite Captcha? Do you reckon it's "Find all the bicycles, crosswalks, traffic lights?" Which one's your favorite? \[laughter\]

**Carlisia Thompson:** Oh, my God, this question -- I never understand why people have to have one favorite. I don't have one favorite of anything.

**Mat Ryer:** You like them all.

**Carlisia Thompson:** In this case I don't like any of them. Can I go with that?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, fair enough. That's fine. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Erik St. Martin:** I like the sites that don't have a Captcha.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Yes...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Who wants security...? I'm with you. Erik. Erik St. Martin. Twitter? In case people want to troll you on Twitter, what's your Twitter name, Erik?

**Erik St. Martin:** It's my full name with all spaces and punctuation removed. Erik St. Martin, all jammed together.

**Mat Ryer:** Erik with a K though, isn't it?

**Erik St. Martin:** The evil way, yes.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, it's the baddie. The baddie way.

**Mark Bates:** And it's the abbreviated St. or the full Saint?

**Erik St. Martin:** It's the abbreviated one.

**Mark Bates:** See? This is what we ask.

**Erik St. Martin:** Which is my legal name.

**Mat Ryer:** Is it?

**Erik St. Martin:** Unless we're talking to an automated system, and then sometimes I'm Erik Street Martin, because... \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** That's what I thought it was, yeah.

**Brian Ketelsen:** Or unless it's Microsoft, in which he's just St. Erik.

**Erik St. Martin:** Yes, this is true.

**Mark Bates:** Oh, that's pretty cool. That's not a bad title to have.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Erik, are you a sort of light mode or dark mode person? What sort of mode--

**Erik St. Martin:** Dark mode. Definitely dark mode.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. With a K, isn't it? It's the baddie K, so...

**Erik St. Martin:** Yup.

**Carlisia Thompson:** I wish that had been my question... \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Natalie Pistunovich... How do people reach you on Twitter, Natalie?

**Natalie Pistunovich:** For the non-Germans in the crowd, it's Natalie. For the Germans, it's Natalie without h. So it's N-A-T-A-L-I-E, and then P-I-S, the first three letters of my last name.

**Mat Ryer:** Brilliant. So that people can find you. We'll put these Twitter names in the show notes, too, for those that can't follow this chaos. Natalie, what would you say is your favorite modifier key on the keyboard? Cmd, Option? I know it's not Shift...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** How do you know that?

**Natalie Pistunovich:** \[laughs\] Because Mat always complains that I never use upper-case. I always just type lower-case everything, and also no other commas, and so on. Yeah, I have none... But can I answer Carlisia's question?

**Mat Ryer:** Yes, please.

**Natalie Pistunovich:** About my favorite Captcha.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, what is it?

**Natalie Pistunovich:** The fire extinguishers. Because a person who does not live in the U.S. will not recognize those. Or a person who has not seen any American ones will not necessarily recognize those.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Wow...

**Mat Ryer:** That's true. But you'd probably figure it out. What on Earth is that little thing if not that? What else could it be?

**Natalie Pistunovich:** That's like two different types of tests that you're going through. It's fun.

**Mat Ryer:** Very good. Kris Brandow is here... Kris Brandow.

**Kris Brandow:** \[00:11:57.10\] Hello.

**Mat Ryer:** It sounds like a movie star name, doesn't it?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Like Marlon Brando.

**Mat Ryer:** No.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, it does sound like that. What's your Twitter handle?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** My Twitter name is @skriptble.

**Mat Ryer:** Very cool. That sounds like it was a startup at some point. Kris, if you had to pick one, what would you say is your favorite GUID?

**Carlisia Thompson:** Favorite what?!

**Mat Ryer:** GUID. Globally Unique Identifier. Microsoft loves GUIDs. Do you have a favorite, Kris? Any have caught your eye?

**Kris Brandow:** No, so I'll just answer Erik's question instead, because I like that one... So I prefer Dark Mode for my editor, and Light Mode for everything else.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, cool. Yeah.

**Kris Brandow:** I wanna strike that balance.

**Mat Ryer:** Cool. Okay. I'm really not getting the respect I'd hoped for on this, with people just choosing their own questions... But let's press on. We'll press on.

**Erik St. Martin:** That's the problem with having a show full of hosts.

**Mat Ryer:** That's true.

**Carlisia Thompson:** I'm sorry, have we met? \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Angelica Hill's here's, aren't you, Angelica? What's your Twitter name?

**Angelica Hill:** It's my name, @angelica\_hill. Just bog standard.

**Mat Ryer:** You have to type it in a British accent, or any...?

**Angelica Hill:** Yeah, it's mandatory. Think British. So think British \[unintelligible 00:13:13.09\]

**Mark Bates:** And the @ sign is on the other side...

**Angelica Hill:** Obviously, yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Angelica Hill:** The correct side.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Angelica, what would you say is the best HTML tag? So your divs, your spans, your p's... Which one would you go with if you had to pick one, which you definitely do?

**Angelica Hill:** Probably script, just because when I was first learning software engineering I was obsessed with just shoving JavaScript in... I didn't wanna have separate files; just shove it in.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, that's a good answer, I like that... Although it's wrong. The answer is "a", because without that, it's not--

**Angelica Hill:** There's no wrong answers, Mat.

**Mat Ryer:** There are no right or wrong answers. \[laughter\]

**Angelica Hill:** How dare you discriminate against my answer?

**Mat Ryer:** No, you're absolutely right.

**Angelica Hill:** You get all whiny about people not answering your questions, and I answer it...

**Erik St. Martin:** And then it's wrong. \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** \[unintelligible 00:14:04.21\]

**Angelica Hill:** You're not really encouraging people, are you?

**Mark Bates:** I love when people call Mat out. This is great.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. I've got different feelings in my tummy.

**Mark Bates:** Yay, Angelica! I wanna be on her team.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Angelica, you're my best friend.

**Angelica Hill:** Oh my gosh, I love this... \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. If I go red, it's just lighting.

**Carlisia Thompson:** It's your coat.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** The jacket.

**Carlisia Thompson:** The jacket, yes. It's a reflection.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, it's just a reflection of this. It's not anger.

**Carlisia Thompson:** You came well prepared, Mat. You know your crowd.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, exactly. I do. I've made a terrible mistake. Okay, Johnny Boursiquot - what if people want to ping you on Twitter and get loads of free advice, how would they do it? What's your Twitter name?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Actually, you can just search Google, "Johnny Golang", or "Golang Johnny." That'll take you to me.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, that is a cool answer, isn't it?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Oh, do you want better?

**Natalie Pistunovich:** There's many ways of spelling Johnny.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah, exactly. I'll do you one better. GolangJohnny.com. That'll take you to all the places.

**Carlisia Thompson:** It's much easier than trying to spell out your last name.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah, yeah...

**Mat Ryer:** There's a lot of unnecessary letters in that last name. You could do with a bit of gzip on it.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I know, right? Compress that thing...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, but -- no, I like it, really. Johnny, what's your favorite color, in Hex?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I think I wanna answer Angelica's question...

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, for Pete's sake...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Mine is the blink tag.

**Mat Ryer:** The blink.

**Erik St. Martin:** I was hoping for an old school one, like blink or marquee.

**Brian Ketelsen:** Marquee.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, I love those tags... Oh, dear. So you're not gonna tell us your favorite color in Hex.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** No...

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, fair enough.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I am partial to 000066.

**Mat Ryer:** Ooh, that's deep, deep blue. Very good. That's cool, ain't it? To non-tech people watching this, that probably looks really impressive, doesn't it?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I mean, I did wear a shirt... Well, although not as deep, but -- that kind of gave you the hint, right?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, it did. Let me just get the digital color meter up... I just wanna check to see what color your shirt actually is in Hex... 3259FE, Johnny, actually...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** \[00:16:00.28\] Oh, okay. Thanks for --

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, no probs. Okay... We've got Mark Bates here, too. Mark, are you on Twitter?

**Mark Bates:** I am. I'll just say, I am really scared of whatever my question is gonna be. I am petrified knowing that you're about to ask me a question I've never heard before.

Anyway - yes, I'm on the Twitters, I am on the everythings just as @markbates. Just my full name, that's spelled with the two a's and an r, you can put them wherever you like...

**Mat Ryer:** Nice. You signed up for all of those combinations of accounts...

**Mark Bates:** Just a random wildcarding of Twitter handles, yes.

**Mat Ryer:** Very cool.

**Mark Bates:** I did actually use to have a website, CatapultTheBand.com, but I eventually had to get CatapultHeBand.com, because the two t's - everybody just kept going...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. You don't need to t's, which is why my name only has the one... No, your question is fine, Mark. It's simply, "What's your favorite security question on sign-up forms when you have to choose?"

**Mark Bates:** Oh, geez. That's a great one. Um, the blank one.

**Mat Ryer:** The blank one. There isn't a blank one, is there?

**Mark Bates:** Yeah. The good sites let you write in your own question.

**Mat Ryer:** Right. And what do you write in?

**Natalie Pistunovich:** And what is the answer? \[laughter\]

**Mark Bates:** The question should be "What is your favorite security answer?", not your favorite security question.

**Natalie Pistunovich:** Okay. Thank you very much.

**Erik St. Martin:** I like answering them incorrectly.

**Mat Ryer:** You have to remember that though, don't you? Otherwise you're screwed.

**Erik St. Martin:** You do have to remember that, but nobody's gonna guess it. There's way more ways to lie than there is to tell the truth... So like, "What's your grandmother's name?" Kevin. \[laughter\]

**Mark Bates:** That was my grandmother's name.

**Carlisia Thompson:** And then you just write it on a piece of paper. Problem solved.

**Mark Bates:** Right. Mine are all right underneath my keyboard. Does everybody wanna see? I keep it right here, hang on...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** A sticky note on the monitor? That works, too.

**Mark Bates:** Yeah, I wrote one password at the top, and then I've figured that was good enough.

**Mat Ryer:** That is quite secure there, Mark, because no one wants to come around to your house.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Oh, goodness...

**Mark Bates:** That is true. \[laughter\] Even my family doesn't wanna spend time with me. You're right. That is a very good point.

**Mat Ryer:** I'm obviously joking. Look at the studio he's got. I definitely wanna go and spend time there. Now, sometimes the banter will slip over into hate... And I'm sorry when that happens; it's an accident. I mean it, honestly, all of it, with the utmost love... Mostly.

Okay, well - let's play. I think it's time. We've met the contestants, they're all a wonderful bunch of lovely people... Actually, the first thing we're gonna do is choose our teams. Let me share my telly with you... And I'm using GitHub Codespaces here, and I've written a little program... And this is essentially \[unintelligible 00:18:40.02\] we've got all the players, and a little loop, one to four... I'm just gonna pull out a random player. And this is like a pure function, Erik, for you, so... Kind of rusty, isn't it?

So you pass in the players, we get back the list with the one removed, and... Let's run it and see who's on what team.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Wait, why do you need the second loop if you're just getting the left out --

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I was worrying somebody was gonna start debugging this... \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Team two.

**Carlisia Thompson:** You're just getting the left four, or however... Yeah.

**Brian Ketelsen:** Oh, man... \[laughter\] Code review is harsh...

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, I'm getting a code review... \[laughter\]

**Mark Bates:** I mean, she brings up a very good point, Mat.

**Carlisia Thompson:** I mean, you really don't need that loop there at all.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, this is great. This is great for me. \[laughter\] Because it's similar code, if you must know... Once you've learned the first one, you know what the second one's doing. Alright...

**Mark Bates:** But you don't need the second one.

**Carlisia Thompson:** I mean, I think you need the loop, but you don't need --

**Mark Bates:** \[unintelligible 00:19:37.03\]

**Kris Brandow:** I don't think you need half this...

**Erik St. Martin:** I mean, realistically, you could --

**Carlisia Thompson:** You don't need to randomize it.

**Erik St. Martin:** Even if you wanted to call it twice, you could have abstracted it.

**Mark Bates:** Right. Just \[unintelligible 00:19:47.21\] the names.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah, Mat.

**Mat Ryer:** Excellent.

**Mark Bates:** \[unintelligible 00:19:50.00\] You don't even need the loop, for crying out loud.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Goodness...

**Mat Ryer:** Excellent. \[laughter\] Well, at least we have our teams from this. Team one - Erik, Natalie, Mark and Angelica. And team two is Brian, Carlisia, Johnny and Kris. There we have it. If you're not happy with the teams, you can blame \[unintelligible 00:20:12.24\]

**Brian Ketelsen:** \[00:20:14.23\] Or bad for loops.

**Mark Bates:** Blame Mat Ryer, is that what you said? It sounded like Mat Ryer through my headphones...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah, a little bit. Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** I mean, I would be honored to have a package named after me in the standard library. So if that's what we're getting at, then I'm on board. Let's go for round one. To decide who's gonna have the board, which we'll see in a moment, we're gonna have to do a face-off. Or if you like puns, an interface-off. So we'll pick Erik and Brian. You are two team captains. You two are gonna take part in the face-off and we're gonna ask the first question. Let's go.

So this is to figure out who's gonna own the board... What is the least useful Go keyword? What did our survey Gophers say was the least useful Go keyword?

**Brian Ketelsen:** Panic.

**Erik St. Martin:** Goto.

**Mat Ryer:** Hang on... So let's do panic first. Brian, so "Panic"... \[win sound\] It's correct, it's on the board.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Does the naked return have a keyword? No, right?

**Mat Ryer:** Just return, I guess... Is it?

**Carlisia Thompson:** No, no, no. Return is very useful. \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, return is quite useful, isn't it?

**Carlisia Thompson:** It is, isn't it?

**Mark Bates:** It has its moments...

**Mat Ryer:** It does. Okay. Erik, what was your guess?

**Erik St. Martin:** Goto.

**Mat Ryer:** Gophers say... \[win sound\] Top answer. Okay, so Erik, you go the top answer there, so your team now controls the board. We're gonna go around your team in order, and take guesses. Remember, you have three lives. If you lose those three lives, it gives Brian's team the chance to steal. So Natalie, let's have your guess, please. What's the least useful Go keyword, Natalie?

**Angelica Hill:** Fallthrough.

**Mat Ryer:** Fallthrough. Gophers say... \[win sound\]

**Erik St. Martin:** It's gonna be like number four.

**Mat Ryer:** Yes, second--

**Erik St. Martin:** Oh, number two. Alright.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, it's a very good guess. Okay. We've got lots of points on the scorebard... Let's see if we can get some more. It's Mr. Bates' turn. Careful, it's Mark Bates' turn... Mark, what's your guess? What's the least useful Go keyword?

**Mark Bates:** I was gonna say fallthrough. That was my big guess.

**Mat Ryer:** What are you gonna say now...?

**Mark Bates:** What am I gonna say... Hang on a second. So there's only 24 of them. \[unintelligible 00:22:36.09\]

**Carlisia Thompson:** There's like 25, I don't know...

**Erik St. Martin:** 25.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Yeah. But I don't know what they are... \[laughter\]

**Mark Bates:** I should. I teach them all the time. \[laughter\] That's what's so bad. I'm gonna say -- is "iota" a keyword?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Kris Brandow:** No...

**Mark Bates:** No, it's not a keyword. So I'm gonna say...

**Carlisia Thompson:** Oh, I know. I have one. I have one.

**Mark Bates:** Well, you can't tell--

**Kris Brandow:** Don't say it.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Sorry. When it's my turn, I have one.

**Mat Ryer:** It's not gonna be, unless they lose all their lives... Because Erik won the board.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Alright.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. So you're good on this one.

**Carlisia Thompson:** I have one that I think is a good one if-- \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Mark, can you say a keyboard, please, mate?

**Mark Bates:** Yes. \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** Just say one.

**Mark Bates:** I am gonna say what people think is a least useful Go keyword...

**Mat Ryer:** Ah, say it...!

**Mark Bates:** I don't agree with that, but I'm gonna say "select".

**Mat Ryer:** Select.

**Carlisia Thompson:** No...

**Mat Ryer:** And the gophers say... \[fail sound\]

**Erik St. Martin:** No...

**Mat Ryer:** I'm sorry, no... Select is not a good one.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Can I go, can I go?

**Kris Brandow:** No, they have three more lives.

**Mat Ryer:** No, I'm afraid not, Carlisia, because we've got rules in this game. Next up is Angelica. Angelica, which is the least useful Go keyword?

**Angelica Hill:** So now I find them all pretty useful at this stage... \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** So we've got goto at number one, 35 gophers said that. Fallthrough is at number two, that's 26 gophers. And then in the fifth place on the board is panic, with five. So we're looking for spaces three and four now. What could be in there...?

**Angelica Hill:** Maybe continue...?

**Mat Ryer:** \[00:24:12.10\] Continue. Gophers say... \[fail sound\]

**Carlisia Thompson:** No...

**Mat Ryer:** No, I'm sorry...

**Angelica Hill:** I gave it a go...

**Mat Ryer:** So you've lost two lives. We're gonna loop back around.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Can I go?

**Mat Ryer:** Nope, I'm afraid not, Carlisia. \[laughter\]

**Carlisia Thompson:** When can I go? I haven't gone yet.

**Mat Ryer:** Unless they lose their final life, and then you get a chance to steal, and then you might be able to steal and win all the points. So that will be very exciting. Okay, Erik, back to you; another guess.

**Erik St. Martin:** I'm gonna go with const.

**Mat Ryer:** Const?

**Erik St. Martin:** Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** Gophers say... \[fail sound\] I'm sorry, it's not there. And you've lost three lives.

**Erik St. Martin:** I'm trying to think of the ones that you use the least.

**Mat Ryer:** So now that means team two has a chance to steal. You're welcome to confer, so you can just chat amongst each other. So Carlisia... It's your time to shine!

**Carlisia Thompson:** Wait, can I go? Can I go?

**Kris Brandow:** Wait, we can confer. We can confer. Let's talk.

**Mat Ryer:** You have to tell Brian.

**Brian Ketelsen:** Let's confer.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Where are we conferring?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Right now, right here.

**Erik St. Martin:** It's not like we can steal your answer at this point...

**Kris Brandow:** I feel like "break" should probably be in there somewhere...

**Carlisia Thompson:** No, no, no. Mine is better.

**Kris Brandow:** What's yours?

**Carlisia Thompson:** New.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yup. New is one of them. Else is another one...

**Kris Brandow:** New isn't a keyword, is it?

**Carlisia Thompson:** Yes, it is.

**Kris Brandow:** I don't panic is a keyword either, so...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** New is not a keyword. New is not a keyword.

**Brian Ketelsen:** No.

**Kris Brandow:** New isn't a keyword. But also panic is not a keyword, so I don't know...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Oh, that's true...

**Erik St. Martin:** Oh, yeah...

**Brian Ketelsen:** I have to go with import.

**Carlisia Thompson:** New is sort of like a function. Yeah, it's not a keyword.

**Mat Ryer:** This isn't right or wrong. This is just what the Gophers answered.

**Brian Ketelsen:** Import. We don't need other people's code. \[laughter\]

**Carlisia Thompson:** No. \[laughs\]

**Brian Ketelsen:** No, my vote is for break.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Okay, so we've got break, we've got new, and I'll throw in else.

**Kris Brandow:** Oh, else is a good one, too.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Those are useful.

**Kris Brandow:** You shouldn't put else in your code... But I think break should probably be, because -- well, I don't know.

**Brian Ketelsen:** Okay, so what's your answer then, Brian? You have to choose.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Hardcore gophers would say else shouldn't exist maybe, but...

**Mark Bates:** They use break all the time...

**Carlisia Thompson:** It's very common.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Remember, this isn't about right or wrong. This is what the other Gophers have answered to this question.

**Kris Brandow:** I mean, clearly this isn't about right or wrong. Panic is not here, so...

**Carlisia Thompson:** Can we look at the list? Because we're not gonna go anywhere... We don't know --

**Johnny Boursiquot:** No, we narrowed it down. We just have to pick the last two, between new, else and break.

**Carlisia Thompson:** I think there's more to the list than those.

**Mat Ryer:** Pick one. Final answer. Otherwise we're just gonna move to the next board.

**Kris Brandow:** Break? Should we go with break?

**Carlisia Thompson:** Sorry, break and what else?

**Mat Ryer:** You just have to only guess one. Your guess is break... Gophers say... Is it break? \[fail sound\] Oh, I'm sorry. No.

**Kris Brandow:** I'm telling you, new and else.

**Mat Ryer:** Let's reveal the board. Number one, we had goto. Number two was fallthrough. Number three... New.

**Kris Brandow:** It's not a keyword! \[laughter\]

**Carlisia Thompson:** I said that! Do we get the points?

**Mat Ryer:** No, Carlisia. I'm afraid not.

**Brian Ketelsen:** This is fake news.

**Mat Ryer:** Number four, else.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Oh, look at that.

**Kris Brandow:** Ohhh, Johnny...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I told you. \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** This may be fake news... This is what the Gophers said. That's the game.

**Carlisia Thompson:** But I guessed it.

**Mat Ryer:** I really did spell this out a lot.

**Carlisia Thompson:** I don't understand this game. I guessed the word though.

**Brian Ketelsen:** But it's wrong.

**Mat Ryer:** I know, but I had to take a final answer from your team, Captain Brian.

**Mark Bates:** I have to agree with Brian... Unless they were shown a list of keywords, letting them just randomly guess keywords that are functions is...

**Mat Ryer:** Why did we choose to play this game with a bunch of pedants?

**Mark Bates:** Like, because they could have said anything...

**Erik St. Martin:** Technically, the rules of the game is it's not really what's accurate, right? It's what do we think most people said.

**Mark Bates:** Exactly.

**Mat Ryer:** This is what people said. We asked them. This is what they said. This is the data.

**Brian Ketelsen:** Yeah, but which people did you ask, Mark?

**Mark Bates:** Look, it's like saying "What's your favorite movie?" and someone says "The TV guide", and you're like "Okay, you win."

**Natalie Pistunovich:** If we had documentation, we would not have this argument at all. Just saying.

**Break:** \[00:28:03.04\]

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, it's time to go to the next round. Team one bagged themselves 66 delicious points there. Now we all understand the rules and we're not gonna argue about it anymore, we can go on to round two.

**Mark Bates:** Aren't I on team one?

**Natalie Pistunovich:** I have a list here of team one...

**Mark Bates:** I don't have the list. Where is the list?

**Natalie Pistunovich:** This is the list.

**Mark Bates:** Oh, great. I'm winning. Never mind. \[laughter\]

**Erik St. Martin:** What was your first programming language? Okay...

**Mark Bates:** I take back anything I said.

**Erik St. Martin:** This one's a good one.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. So we're gonna do an Interface-off again... This time we're gonna ask for Natalie and Carlisia. Natalie, first of all, what was your first programming language? What did the Gophers say to this, Natalie?

**Natalie Pistunovich:** Python.

**Mat Ryer:** Python. Gophers say... \[win sound\] Correct. And let's see where it is on the board... It's right bang in the middle, at number four. We've got seven items on the board here, number four there - Python. Carlisia, if you can beat this, that means your team takes the --

**Carlisia Thompson:** Ruby. Ruby will be that.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** \[unintelligible 00:30:23.11\]

**Erik St. Martin:** It's like all the OG Gophers... \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, Ruby. Let's see. Gophers say... \[fail sound\] No. Nobody said it.

**Carlisia Thompson:** What?! Who answered this survey?!

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Not Rubyists...

**Erik St. Martin:** I guess that makes sense, this is first programming language.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, yeah. Okay, that means Natalie's team takes the board. That's team one again. But don't worry, there's always a change to steal if they lose their three lives.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Stop the steal.

**Mat Ryer:** So Mark Bates... What do you think?

**Mark Bates:** I'm gonna say most people said JavaScript.

**Erik St. Martin:** Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** Gophers say... \[fail sound\]

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Wow.

**Mat Ryer:** This is amazing, I know. So you lose a life, unfortunately.

**Erik St. Martin:** Right, like, who answered this? \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** The answers are anonymous. We have to protect the identities of our sources.

**Mark Bates:** I should hope so, because we might have to find them after this show and \[unintelligible 00:31:16.01\]

**Mat Ryer:** Exactly.

**Carlisia Thompson:** We have to have a conversation...

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, Angelica, it's time for you to have guess of which programming language was the people's first one. What would you think it is?

**Angelica Hill:** Maybe Go... It was my first software engineering language.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Gophers say...

**Natalie Pistunovich:** Nice.

**Mat Ryer:** \[fail sound\]

**Angelica Hill:** Really?

**Mat Ryer:** No. Nobody said Go.

**Natalie Pistunovich:** I still find this impressive, Angelica; that's an awesome answer, even though it's not here.

**Angelica Hill:** How old is this Go community? Come on...

**Mat Ryer:** We don't have the demographics...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** \[unintelligible 00:31:44.23\]

**Kris Brandow:** Yeah.

**Angelica Hill:** We'll get it next time, guys.

**Mat Ryer:** Erik, your turn. Come on, let's get some points.

**Erik St. Martin:** This one has to be on there - C is gonna be on there.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, let's see.

**Kris Brandow:** Yeah, it's gotta be there.

**Mat Ryer:** \[00:32:00.26\] Gophers say... \[win sound\] Yes! And it's at number three, with 11 of our surveyed Gophers said C. You have a life remaining, so let's go. Natalie, it's your turn again. Pick a language. Be careful, one life left.

**Natalie Pistunovich:** Pascal.

**Mat Ryer:** Pascal. Gophers say... \[win sound\] Yes, it's on there.

**Natalie Pistunovich:** Woo-hoo!

**Carlisia Thompson:** What?!

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Wow...

**Natalie Pistunovich:** That was my first programming language.

**Mat Ryer:** Number two.

**Kris Brandow:** What on Earth...? Wow, okay...

**Carlisia Thompson:** Alright... It's not going where I expected

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, this is amazing.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** So now you get an idea who answered this question.

**Erik St. Martin:** Yup, yup...

**Natalie Pistunovich:** I didn't answer...

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, Mark, back around to you...

**Mark Bates:** Okay, I'm gonna go with one of my first languages, which is now a big enterprise language, but they teach it in schools all the time... I'm gonna say show me Java!

**Carlisia Thompson:** Yes!

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Definitely.

**Mat Ryer:** Gophers say... \[win sound\] Yes, indeed.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Probably number one, or something.

**Mat Ryer:** Let's see... It's at number six.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Oh, wow.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, just seven people started with Java.

**Erik St. Martin:** Okay, okay, so I know what number one is... I can tell...

**Carlisia Thompson:** I think I know, too.

**Mat Ryer:** Hold on, because before that is... Angelica! It's your turn.

**Angelica Hill:** They all know what it is; I don't.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, it's your turn. There's no conferring, remember...

**Angelica Hill:** Okay, maybe just like Morse-code me with winks...

**Mat Ryer:** Beep-beep-beep-beep-beep... It means "Get a move on, please."

**Angelica Hill:** Just let me take my time, Mat...

**Mat Ryer:** No we haven't really got time because of all the \[unintelligible 00:33:29.13\]

**Angelica Hill:** Oh, goodness. Well, that's your fault, isn't it? \[laughter\]

**Mark Bates:** So glad she's on my team. So glad.

**Mat Ryer:** The thing is - that accent sounds really authentic.

**Angelica Hill:** Um, let's go with -- well, given the tone thus far, maybe Scala?

**Mat Ryer:** Scala. Gophers say... \[fail sound\] No. And that's unfortunately your lives over, but don't worry; team two, it's your opportunity to steal now. We just need one correct answer, and you take all of the points. You gobble them all up. You eat all the points. Take them all!

**Carlisia Thompson:** I think I know which one it is...

**Brian Ketelsen:** My vote is for Basic.

**Carlisia Thompson:** No, don't say Basic. No.

**Erik St. Martin:** Let's confer...

**Kris Brandow:** We're conferring. We're conferring.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Let's confer.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Can I say what I think it is?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** You can.

**Kris Brandow:** What do you think it is?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** We're conferring, this is not our official answer.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Alright. It's PHP, in my opinion.

**Kris Brandow:** I was gonna say that.

**Brian Ketelsen:** I'm sure PHP is on there, too.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I can see that, yeah.

**Brian Ketelsen:** But I bet Basic is on the top.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Totally.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Alright, I think we agree. Php.

**Kris Brandow:** Yeah.

**Brian Ketelsen:** We don't agree...

**Mat Ryer:** Brian, I have to take it from the team captain.

**Brian Ketelsen:** I'm not the team captain.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** You are.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Who made Brian the team captain?

**Mat Ryer:** He came out first...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I think it's Carlisia. Carlisia is the team captain. \[laughter\]

**Brian Ketelsen:** It's two to one. They say PHP, so let's go with PHP.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, PHP. Gophers say... \[win sound\] Yes! You do it, and you steal the points. It was at number five there, with nine people starting with PHP.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Okay, I think number one is gonna be one of those things like - this is not a language.

**Erik St. Martin:** It's gonna be Basic.

**Brian Ketelsen:** It's Basic.

**Natalie Pistunovich:** C\#.

**Carlisia Thompson:** It's gonna be Yaml.

**Mat Ryer:** Let's see what was at number first... \[unintelligible 00:35:00.16\]

**Carlisia Thompson:** Wow... Wow!

**Erik St. Martin:** I knew it was gonna be Basic, with this theme...

**Kris Brandow:** Yeah, yeah...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, Basic. And number one...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Pascal, and stuff? I mean, who says Pascal... Unless you've done Basic. \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Basic, Pascal, C, Python, PHP, Java, and at number seven was C++.

**Brian Ketelsen:** That's not a language... \[laughter\]

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Shots fired.

**Mark Bates:** I don't think Etc. is a language either...

**Kris Brandow:** Yeah... What?! \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** It probably is...

**Carlisia Thompson:** Etc... \[laughs\]

**Mark Bates:** Well, we said a bunch of stuff that could fall into Etc...

**Carlisia Thompson:** Right?!

**Mark Bates:** Yeah. JavaScript. That falls under Etc. Come on!

**Mat Ryer:** JavaScript didn't get enough to make it to the board. Any with five answers or less don't make it on the board. JavaScript had 2, C\# had three, and actually - believe it or not - ActionScript had three also. Very interesting.

**Kris Brandow:** Wow.

**Erik St. Martin:** Nice.

**Mark Bates:** This crowd is skewing old then, the surveyed.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah, this is an older crowd, for sure.

**Erik St. Martin:** So that tells us a lot about future questions...

**Kris Brandow:** \[00:36:00.04\] Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, I think so. Well, speaking of which, let's move on to round three. Jazz! Okay, the question is...

**Carlisia Thompson:** Ooh... Ooh...

**Mat Ryer:** Which IDE are you most productive in?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Alright, so let's be clear here - we're not talking about a text editor, we're talking about an IDE. A full-blown IDE.

**Kris Brandow:** No, Johnny...

**Mat Ryer:** You can't ask the people who answered the question this.

**Erik St. Martin:** I don't think the community is gonna distinguish between the two of them.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, maybe not.

**Kris Brandow:** Once again, panic is not a keyword, and neither is new. Like... \[laughter\]

**Carlisia Thompson:** Yeah. Johnny, these are people like me...

**Natalie Pistunovich:** It's also not an IDE.

**Carlisia Thompson:** ...who don't know what keywords are. Like me.

**Mark Bates:** Let's watch what we're saying about our listeners, please...

**Carlisia Thompson:** No, like me. I said--

**Mark Bates:** They're all really awesome people... \[laughs\]

**Carlisia Thompson:** ...they are like me, and they would think things that are not keywords are keywords.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, it's time anyway for the Interface-off between Mark Bates and Johnny Boursiquot. Step to the podium, please, gentlemen... Metaphorically.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Bring it.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, Mark, first of all.

**Mark Bates:** I'm gonna go with the -- while it might not be my first choice, the incredibly popular VS Code.

**Mat Ryer:** Gophers say... \[win sound\] Yes. And it's at number one. 44 people out of 100 Gophers surveyed said VS Code. And it's the one I use, actually. Mark, because you're at number one, Johnny, I'm sorry, go and sit down. You don't get to compete now. He did it, he got the top answer there, at 44, with VS Code.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Well, it was too easy of an answer.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, there we go.

**Mark Bates:** That was -- that was a really good one. I liked this question. We should have more like this.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Well, I know what number two is if anybody is wondering...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Can we see the full list? I think Vim's on there...

**Mat Ryer:** Hold on, because we're still gonna play the game.

**Kris Brandow:** Johnny, why are you telling them -- don't give them ideas.

**Mark Bates:** You still have a chance to steal. We have to go through the rest of the list, Johnny.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Well, it's not like y'all were gonna guess that... I mean --

**Mat Ryer:** It's fine. Okay.

**Mark Bates:** I've never heard of Vim before. What is that? \[laughter\]

**Erik St. Martin:** And there's a couple people on here who are old-school Vim users, so I don't think -- nobody's surprised by it.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Angelica, it's your turn to have a guess...

**Angelica Hill:** This is really difficult. I think I'm gonna go with Vim... \[laughter\]

**Carlisia Thompson:** That's gonna be number two.

**Erik St. Martin:** Okay. Vim. Gophers say... \[win sound\] Correct! And it is in fact number three.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Oh, Neovim...

**Mat Ryer:** Vim, or Neovim. We've got nine people saying that. Very interesting. So we still have option two to guess, four and five. Let's see if we can do it. You have three lives... Erik, what do you think?

**Erik St. Martin:** Alright, I'm gonna go with Emacs here, too.

**Mat Ryer:** Emacs, baby. Gophers say... \[win sound\] Yes...!

**Angelica Hill:** On a roll!

**Mat Ryer:** At number five.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Can I go? Can I go? \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Carlisia, how about I tell you when it's your turn? We'll do that system.

**Natalie Pistunovich:** If Carlisia wants to give our team points, I think it's fine.

**Mark Bates:** Sure. What was your idea, just out of curiosity?

**Angelica Hill:** Yeah, do let us know...

**Carlisia Thompson:** Can I say?

**Mat Ryer:** No, no, no...

**Kris Brandow:** No! It's not our turn yet.

**Mat Ryer:** It's Natalie's turn first. So Natalie, what do you think?

**Natalie Pistunovich:** We may be thinking of the same thing, Carlisia... IntelliJ.

**Carlisia Thompson:** I was not thinking that, but that's a good one.

**Mat Ryer:** IntelliJ. Gophers say... \[win sound\]

**Erik St. Martin:** Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** At number four there, IntelliJ. Yes. With six people.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Can I go, can I go now?

**Kris Brandow:** No.

**Mat Ryer:** I'm afraid not.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Darn it...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, I know. It's frustrating, isn't it? But it is always the same rules. In fact, that means it's back to Mark Bates, who's gonna now have his guess.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Mark, I know the answer, Mark. I know the answer.

**Mark Bates:** Do you wanna tell me what it is?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Don't...

**Mat Ryer:** You have three lives...

**Mark Bates:** You can text it to me. You have my number... Go for it. I'll wait. I've got a minute.

**Mat Ryer:** Bates, you don't have a minute.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Can I do that?

**Kris Brandow:** Apparently, Carlisia does not wanna win the game...

**Erik St. Martin:** You know you're on different teams, right Carlisia?

**Carlisia Thompson:** I wasn't listening when the rules were being explained...

**Mat Ryer:** And now we're all paying the price.

**Mark Bates:** You're not supposed to give the other team the answers, that's the first rule...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** \[00:39:58.22\] There are two teams, and you're not on Mark's.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Oh, Mark is not on my team...

**Mat Ryer:** No, I'm afraid not.

**Kris Brandow:** No.

**Mark Bates:** Not this time, sorry. \[laughter\]

**Carlisia Thompson:** I have to go look it up. Hold on. I'll be right back.

**Mat Ryer:** \[unintelligible 00:40:06.27\]

**Natalie Pistunovich:** I wrote it on paper, if that helps... I'm sorry for my bad handwriting, but here's the list. Maybe it's \[unintelligible 00:40:12.11\]

**Mark Bates:** I swear I asked somebody to put the list in Slack or Zoom earlier, so we can avoid this confusion... But anyway, it's my turn. So I'm gonna go with Goland.

**Mat Ryer:** Goland, let's see. Gophers say... \[win sound\] Correct indeed, and you win the round, and you win the points.

**Kris Brandow:** Did we really separate Goland and IntelliJ?

**Carlisia Thompson:** I thought IntelliJ was the same as Goland.

**Kris Brandow:** Yeah, why are those two separate?

**Brian Ketelsen:** They are...

**Carlisia Thompson:** I thought they were the same.

**Mark Bates:** Because they're two separate products by IntelliJ.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Alright...

**Mark Bates:** Why is new a keyword now? \[unintelligible 00:40:47.18\]

**Kris Brandow:** Vim and Neovim are together, and those are two separate things...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Listen, listen... It's not what we think, it's what everybody else thinks. It's not what we think.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, team one has 161 points, team two is trailing with 47, but it's all still to play for...

**Erik St. Martin:** We've set out for Family Feud, we got Jerry Springer... \[laughter\]

**Carlisia Thompson:** I was gonna say Sublime, by the way...

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, that's a good guess. Yeah, we did get a few other mentions. We had Sublime Text, Text Edit, the Unix Shell, and "a wet piece of string". \[laughter\]

**Johnny Boursiquot:** What?!

**Carlisia Thompson:** You have me at Unix Shell, but "a wet piece of string"? Okay...

**Mark Bates:** Oh, wait a minute, I was in that survey...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I'll throw in a shout-out to my Notepad++ folks out there... Just a shout-out to you.

**Erik St. Martin:** I wanna watch whoever it is that's using the Unix Shell. Is this just like echoing strings and concatting a file continuously, and then sed to update it?

**Mat Ryer:** It must be.

**Erik St. Martin:** I wanna see what this workflow looks like,

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I like stream editors. Forget this IDE stuff.

**Mat Ryer:** Those people are wizards... Or witches...

**Kris Brandow:** I have a question about the rules... Does team one always get to guess first in the face-off?

**Mat Ryer:** Um...

**Kris Brandow:** Because we won the last round, but team one guessed first.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** That's true.

**Mat Ryer:** It's a fair point. Yeah, I didn't run them as the seed, did I?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Mat. Bad host.

**Mat Ryer:** We'll make sure we make up for it. In our next round, which is round four... Okay, round four... And we wanna bring to the head to head now - it's gonna be Kris and Angelica. Come to the podium, please.

**Kris Brandow:** Wait, what?! What is this question?

**Angelica Hill:** Oh, I know...

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, so this is like, in text speak, which text abbreviation do you use the most? And Kris...

**Mark Bates:** Wait a minute, that was not an explanation. You gave a GoDoc standard library answer. You used the same words five times, and then ended the sentence.

**Kris Brandow:** What's the context for this question?

**Carlisia Thompson:** Okay, what were the Changelog people drinking when they did this? \[laughter\]

**Johnny Boursiquot:** LOL...

**Carlisia Thompson:** You guys...?!

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Does that count?

**Mark Bates:** "In text speak, when abbreviating, what's your favorite text abbreviation?" What does that mean?

**Kris Brandow:** What does that have to do with Go?

**Mat Ryer:** Look, this is simple...

**Carlisia Thompson:** Is it like, when I'm texting? When I'm sexting? What?! \[laughter\]

**Mark Bates:** \[unintelligible 00:43:10.04\]

**Carlisia Thompson:** I need to know more. I need more information. What does this mean?

**Mat Ryer:** Peach emoji.

**Mark Bates:** This is not about Go...

**Mat Ryer:** Look, let me explain this, because I think the crux of this is escaping a few of us a little bit... This is the question that was asked, we've collected the answers and counted them; what did people say when they were asked this question? It's as simple as that. It's as simple as that.

**Kris Brandow:** Oh, Lord...

**Angelica Hill:** I'm ready, I've got one.

**Mat Ryer:** Kris. We're gonna go first to Kris.

**Angelica Hill:** I'm ready.

**Mat Ryer:** Kris, what's your guess?

**Kris Brandow:** I don't know the context. Is this like abbreviations in Go code, or abbreviations in general?

**Mat Ryer:** In text speak, when you're texting.

**Erik St. Martin:** I don't think we gave the people --

**Mark Bates:** \[00:43:55.15\] In text speak, abbreviations - what are the text abbreviations in text speak that abbreviate the most text abbreviations...?

**Angelica Hill:** Yeah, exactly. How is that not clear?

**Erik St. Martin:** I think we just have to guess who we think people interpreted this...

**Kris Brandow:** Oh, God...

**Mat Ryer:** What do you think, Kris?

**Kris Brandow:** Alright, I'll just go with the most generic one, LOL...

**Mat Ryer:** LOL. Gophers say... \[win sound\]

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah, there you go.

**Mat Ryer:** There you go. And it's the top answer, which means team two takes the board. You're in control of the board now... So we're gonna go through the team. This is gonna be good. Brian, you're up next. What's your guess? Which text abbreviation do you use the most?

**Brian Ketelsen:** BRB.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Boom.

**Mat Ryer:** BRB. Gophers say... \[fail sound\] No, I'm afraid...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** What?! Who are these people?

**Mat Ryer:** They're people that don't leave for a little short while. That's who they are. Okay, don't worry; you've just lost a life, but two lives left. Carlisia! It's time! It's your guess.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Okay, if RLOL shows up on this board, I'm gonna be mad, because they should go together with LOL. So now I don't know...

**Mark Bates:** Usually you're desperate to give us an answer. Come on...

**Natalie Pistunovich:** I was thinking either LGTM or K8S.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** We can confer, if you'd like.

**Mat Ryer:** You can't.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** We cannot?

**Mat Ryer:** No, you can't confer until you're stealing.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Wow. These rules, man...

**Mat Ryer:** I know. I know. Alright, Carlisia, what do you think? What's your guess?

**Carlisia Thompson:** Rolling on the floor laughing, or RLOL. So... I'm just gonna expect that that's in there.

**Mat Ryer:** ROFL. Gophers say... \[fail sound\] No, I'm sorry. Nobody said that.

**Natalie Pistunovich:** I think the safest one is LGTM, for sure.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Nobody said that... Who are these people?!

**Kris Brandow:** The top answer only has ten, so...

**Carlisia Thompson:** Nobody said that...

**Mark Bates:** I don't think I've ever typed that in my life.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** LOL?

**Kris Brandow:** ROLF? Really?

**Mark Bates:** No, the rolling on the floor laughing.

**Erik St. Martin:** Does anybody remember the Roflcopter?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Mm-hm.

**Kris Brandow:** Roflcopter, yeah...!

**Mat Ryer:** What is it?

**Carlisia Thompson:** No, I don't remember that.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, Johnny. Your turn. Two lives left. What do you think?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** AFK?

**Mat Ryer:** AFK. Gophers say... \[fail sound\] No, I'm afraid not.

**Kris Brandow:** What are these abbreviations?!

**Johnny Boursiquot:** AFK? Away From Keyboard. You never used that one?

**Natalie Pistunovich:** Is "don't" considered an abbreviation?

**Kris Brandow:** No, I'm like -- what do people think of abbreviations? If AFK, BRB, all of these are not there... What is this?!

**Carlisia Thompson:** They don't leave the keyboard, Johnny.

**Mat Ryer:** You lose another life, I'm afraid... But don't worry, you still have another life. Kris, what do you think?

**Kris Brandow:** Oh, goodness... Text abbreviations... I'm trying to think of ones I actually use. I don't abbreviate things very often.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Brian is trying to help you, Kris.

**Angelica Hill:** That's not allowed.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, he's not on that team.

**Kris Brandow:** \[laughs\] Oh, OMG.

**Mat Ryer:** OMG.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** It's gotta be on there, right?

**Mat Ryer:** Is that on there?

**Angelica Hill:** No.

**Mat Ryer:** \[fail sound\]

**Kris Brandow:** What?!

**Johnny Boursiquot:** OMG... \[laughter\]

**Brian Ketelsen:** How about WTF?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah, WTF...

**Mat Ryer:** I'm afraid that is all your lives...

**Carlisia Thompson:** I am starting to have serious concerns for this community.

**Angelica Hill:** Let's steal!

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, it's time to steal, maybe...

**Angelica Hill:** Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** You're allowed to confer... So what do we think?

**Mark Bates:** Yeah, I was gonna say WTF, team.

**Erik St. Martin:** Yeah, WTF, JK, and the other one I was thinking is if we think about programmers - what about LGTM?

**Natalie Pistunovich:** Those are two different things. E.g. is an example, and i.e. is a different thing.

**Angelica Hill:** I feel that, too. Yeah...

**Mark Bates:** I think it's WTF. I think that's --

**Angelica Hill:** Or TL;DR.

**Mark Bates:** ...everybody uses WTF.

**Erik St. Martin:** Well, people use OMG like crazy too, and why is that not on there?

**Mark Bates:** I know, I know... But these are programmers. They're either gonna tell people to RTFM, or WTF all the time.

**Erik St. Martin:** I think it's either gonna be like LGTM or LMAO.

**Carlisia Thompson:** You guys, you have like five choices. Pick one and go. I wanna see this board.

**Mat Ryer:** Erik? What do you think?

**Erik St. Martin:** I think LGTM. All the other random text ones are not here.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Gophers say, to steal... \[win sound\] Yes! You've got one. At number three, LGTM. So team one steals those delicious points; gobbles them down, eats them all up.

**Angelica Hill:** \[00:48:19.15\] Num num.

**Mat Ryer:** Let's see what else. Number six. We're gonna go with the bottom first... Number six was... People that don't use any abbreviations. \[laughter\]

**Mark Bates:** Really, that was an answer?!

**Johnny Boursiquot:** They always use proper grammatical, well-structured sentences, for all the things, all the time.

**Mat Ryer:** Absolutely.

**Erik St. Martin:** There's always a tweet. Find these people, go through their Twitter accounts. I think they use them.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Number five - six people said this... IIRC. Who knows what that means...?

**Kris Brandow:** If I recall correctly...

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Yeah, very good.

**Erik St. Martin:** IMHO is gonna be one probably then...

**Mat Ryer:** At number four, with seven people, IMO or IMHO. In my humble opinion.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** And WTF. You've gotta have that, right?

**Mat Ryer:** And number two, surprisingly, e.g. \[laughter\]

**Brian Ketelsen:** Who the hell are these people?

**Kris Brandow:** What is this...?!

**Carlisia Thompson:** What is e.g.? Can somebody explain it to me.

**Mat Ryer:** It means example.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** For example, yeah.

**Erik St. Martin:** Do we think that they were trolling us when they answered this?

**Mat Ryer:** Well, we don't know. We'll never know.

**Mark Bates:** Why not i.e.? I see more of that than e.g.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** In other words, right...

**Kris Brandow:** You shouldn't...

**Mark Bates:** Well, I shouldn't. I'm just saying I do.

**Kris Brandow:** E.g. is more grammatically correct, most of the time...

**Mark Bates:** Not arguing that...

**Carlisia Thompson:** Yeah. Is it like i.e, but in a different country? What is this...?

**Kris Brandow:** Well, i.e. is like an exact replacement, where e.g. is like an example... But anyway, this doesn't matter. Let's move on...

**Mat Ryer:** Well, the people that said they don't use them - they left us some comments. They said "I work in a multi-country development team, and I've found that avoiding them is better for the team." And some people say that they're less clear if you don't already know what they mean... So they avoid them; they don't use them. And that's fair enough. That's their right. So they don't need a podcast --

**Kris Brandow:** This is less than half the people though. Where is the rest of the answers? I wanna know what the weird ones were.

**Mat Ryer:** No other answers had five--

**Carlisia Thompson:** I was thinking if "okay" was considered an abbreviation... I mean, it is, but at this point--

**Mat Ryer:** I don't have that data. Actually, that's a good question. I don't know that it is.

**Mark Bates:** Let's move on. We're in round 4 of 20, so I think we should--

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah, we're not gonna finish that...

**Mat Ryer:** We've got six rounds, don't worry.

**Break:** \[00:50:33.07\]

**Mat Ryer:** Our next round - we've given it a little bit of a twist. It's time for Unpopular Opinions!

**Jingle:** \[00:51:29.10\] to \[00:51:45.00\]

**Mat Ryer:** There we go, Acapella edition of Unpopular Opinions there. A little treat for everyone. And I do mean treat.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** That is new.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Who recorded that? Who was singing?

**Mat Ryer:** That's me, when I did the unpopular opinion theme tune, and then someone took out all the music...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Oh, hell no. That is not you.

**Carlisia Thompson:** I love it. I love it. Is it true?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Carlisia Thompson:** I love it, I love it.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Really? Man, he must have auto-tuned you real good...

**Kris Brandow:** \[laughs\]

**Carlisia Thompson:** Oh, excuse me? \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** \[00:52:13.05\] Okay, well - in this round, we've given it a little bit of a twist. We're actually looking for the bottom answers. The things that made it onto the board, but they weren't high-scoring. So we're looking for the unpopular opinions this time. And the question is, if I weren't using Go to write code, I'd be using... What? There's no face-off, we're just gonna bounce between the teams. And we'll start with the trailing team. Brian, what do you think?

**Erik St. Martin:** I think you meant "losers".

**Brian Ketelsen:** "Losers" is the correct term.

**Carlisia Thompson:** I do not like that term, trailing team. I did not like that.

**Mat Ryer:** Really? I thought that was politer...

**Mark Bates:** I think Erik's term, "losers" \[unintelligible 00:52:50.26\]

**Carlisia Thompson:** If you wanna call us losers, call us losers, okay?

**Natalie Pistunovich:** We did win the second round...

**Kris Brandow:** I mean, you only won the second round because Mat cheated for you, so... That's why you have all those points. If he'd done it the right way, we'd be ahead. So...

**Mat Ryer:** Brian. Why do we do this with a bunch of pedantic programmers? This was a terrible idea... \[laughter\]

**Kris Brandow:** All you had to do was follow the rules, Mat...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Sure. I can't follow the rules... Brian, what do we think?

**Brian Ketelsen:** Show me Rust.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Rust. Gophers say... \[win sound\] Yes, indeed.

**Kris Brandow:** But that's gonna be popular...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, quite popular. You get ten points for it though, even though 24 people said it. It's in at number two, so it was quite popular... So we're looking for -- okay, yeah, that's it now. We're gonna bounce over to Erik for a guess. Erik, what do you think?

**Erik St. Martin:** Haskell.

**Mat Ryer:** Pascal. Gophers say...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Did you say Haskell or Pascal?

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, sorry, what did you say?

**Erik St. Martin:** Haskell.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Haskell.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, the initial sound was -- Haskell. \[fail sound\] Haskell is not on the board, I'm afraid. Carlisia, what do you think?

**Carlisia Thompson:** Erik didn't get the gist that people ran away from Pascal to come to Go...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Carlisia Thompson:** And if they didn't do Go, they ran away from Pascal to do something else. \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** What did they run away from then, Carlisia? What do you think they'd be using?

**Carlisia Thompson:** I wanted to say Yaml, to be cheeky, but... Hold on. Hold on.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Don't lose us the points...

**Carlisia Thompson:** I know, I don't wanna throw it away.

**Mat Ryer:** No conferring...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** We need the points. Wait, can't we confer?

**Mat Ryer:** No conferring. Carlisia, what do you think?

**Carlisia Thompson:** Python. Python. Python.

**Mat Ryer:** Python. Okay, let's see. Gophers say... \[win sound\] Indeed. But very popular. Number one.

**Kris Brandow:** Wow.

**Brian Ketelsen:** Oh, yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** So you just get five points, but that's good. It all adds up, as long as you get points. Okay, next up we've got Natalie.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Wait, why is Python five points and the other one is ten points? I don't get it.

**Mat Ryer:** We're looking for unpopular opinions, so it's the opposite now... So the higher up it is, the fewer points there are. We're looking for the ones lower down the board. Number one we have Python, that 26 people said, which earns you five points. Rust is in at number two, 24 people said that, which gives you 10 points... But there's till three, four and five. They're the high-scoring ones, so Natalie, can you find one?

**Natalie Pistunovich:** Scala.

**Mat Ryer:** Scala. Gophers say... \[fail sound\]

**Carlisia Thompson:** So it's an infinite number of points, because it's not there? \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** There we go... No, it's a divide by zero error.

**Natalie Pistunovich:** Yay, we won!

**Carlisia Thompson:** You win, yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Johnny. Johnny, be good. Be good mate, and get one.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Java.

**Mat Ryer:** Java. Gophers say... \[win sound\] Yes, indeed. Where is it? It's at number three. Eight people said it, which gets you 15 delicious points. Very good. Mr. Bates is up next... I mean, Mark Bates. Mark Bates. What do you think, mate?

**Mark Bates:** I'm gonna go with .NET.

**Mat Ryer:** \[00:55:58.10\] .NET, okay. Gophers say... \[win sound\] Yes, we're gonna give you that. People said C\#. Seven people did, which gives you 20 points. What are you gonna spend your points on, Mark? Don't answer, we haven't really got time. Next up, it's Kris' turn. Kris, can you get this last one?

**Kris Brandow:** I'm gonna say JavaScript.

**Mat Ryer:** Are you? Well, let's see what the Gophers say. \[win sound\] Excellent! You've done it! The top scorer. 25 points there, because five people said JavaScript. Very good.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Nice...!

**Carlisia Thompson:** Wow...

**Mat Ryer:** And check out those points there... You're catching up, Team 2. It's not the end of the road yet... We've got another round. Does anyone want to just do some quick banter? But it's gotta be quick. You can just insult me quickly and get it out of the way...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Mat, where's the rest of your hair?

**Mat Ryer:** Johnny, in the land of the bald, the receded man is king. \[laugher\]

**Mark Bates:** On the nose, Johnny. \[unintelligible 00:56:52.22\]

**Mat Ryer:** Um, okay.

**Mark Bates:** That was super-direct.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I know...

**Mark Bates:** \[unintelligible 00:56:55.08\]

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I don't like to beat around the bush. I was saying how wonderful you are.

**Mat Ryer:** No, that was good bants. It was really good bants. Round six though, we're playing for double points. We're back to playing the normal now; we're looking for the top-scoring, but they're double points, which does give a nice opportunity to catch up here, and overtake, and team two could win this. So let's go on to next round. It's round six.

Okay... The question we asked our Gophers is "The most useful package in the standard library is - what?" Now, you can nominate who you want to go head-to-head from each team. Who's gonna go head-to-head?

**Brian Ketelsen:** I pick Johnny.

**Mark Bates:** Team 1, who do we think?

**Mat Ryer:** Team 1 is Erik, Natalie, Mark and Angelica. Who out of those four?

**Mark Bates:** Natalie, Angelica?

**Natalie Pistunovich:** "Alyzah..."

**Mark Bates:** Natalie's like, "Leave me out of this..."

**Natalie Pistunovich:** No, no, no, I was like "Alyzah..."

**Mark Bates:** Way to be a team player, Natalie... \[laughs\]

**Mat Ryer:** She was singing Hamilton.

**Natalie Pistunovich:** No, I said "Alyzah." I was singing to them.

**Erik St. Martin:** I mean, I have an idea for what I think probably the top one is...

**Mark Bates:** We can't confer on an answer, just on who is going to say it, right?

**Mat Ryer:** That's right, yeah.

**Mark Bates:** Okay. Well, if Erik thinks he has a top answer, I'd say we go with him.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, Erik. And Brian, from your team, Brian, Carlisia, Johnny and Kris, who's gonna be going head to head with Erik?

**Carlisia Thompson:** Me.

**Kris Brandow:** Sure.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah?

**Brian Ketelsen:** Go, Carlisia.

**Carlisia Thompson:** No, you guys go. I can think of one, but I think it's the same that Erik is thinking... So if somebody has multiple ideas...

**Brian Ketelsen:** I've got a good one, too.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Yeah, go.

**Mat Ryer:** Team 2 is gonna go first, so Carlisia, if you wanna do it, you get to go first...

**Brian Ketelsen:** Go, Carlisia.

**Carlisia Thompson:** No. Brian, Go. Brian, go.

**Brian Ketelsen:** I'll pick IO.

**Mat Ryer:** IO. Okay. Gophers say... \[win sound\] Oh, indeed, Brian. IO is up there, indeed. At number three, 14 people said that the IO package is the most useful package in the standard library. That earns you 28 delicious points. That's good. Okay, next person is...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Is that still team 2?

**Mat Ryer:** Team 2, yeah. So Carlisia...

**Carlisia Thompson:** Oh, then let me go. Let me go.

**Erik St. Martin:** It's not a face-off?

**Mark Bates:** You said we were bouncing back and forth.

**Mat Ryer:** No, sorry. We're not. Erik, you now have to guess. And if you beat him, you take the board. That's right. So Erik, can you find one...?

**Erik St. Martin:** I thought Brian was gonna steal mine. Nethttp.

**Mat Ryer:** Nethttp. Gophers say, for the steal... \[win sound\] Yes, it's on there. But where is it? It's at the top! The most useful Go package, according to our surveyed Gophers, is Nethttp. 29 people said it, and that earns you a delicious 58 points, and the control of the board... Which means, Natalie, it's your turn to choose the next one guess. Guess one.

**Natalie Pistunovich:** Fmt.

**Mat Ryer:** Would you like to pronounce it properly? \[laughter\]

**Natalie Pistunovich:** I did.

**Carlisia Thompson:** If you don't, you're gonna lose the game.

**Mat Ryer:** Natalie...

**Natalie Pistunovich:** \[01:00:05.18\] The formatting one.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, ftm. Let's see if fmt is up there. Gophers say... \[win sound\] Yes, indeed. And it's at number two, 21 people.

**Kris Brandow:** Oh, boy.

**Carlisia Thompson:** That was the one that I was thinking.

**Natalie Pistunovich:** Great minds, Carlisia.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Great minds, indeed.

**Mat Ryer:** So we've got Nethttp at number one there, fmt at number two... At number three we have the IO package. That leaves four and five open... And we're gonna find out if Mark can figure one of those out. What do you think, Mark?

**Mark Bates:** I have a couple good guesses... But I'm gonna go with one of the most important packages in the Go standard library that we cannot live without day to day, and that's the testing package.

**Mat Ryer:** Beautiful, beautiful. Testify. Let's see, testing. Gophers say... \[win sound\] Yes! It's up there, and it's number four. That gives you a lovely 14 points.

**Erik St. Martin:** I think I know what the last one is, too.

**Mark Bates:** I think it's the other one I didn't say, I hope...

**Mat Ryer:** Well, remember, there's no conferring...

**Carlisia Thompson:** I have in mind one that I hope is the last one. If it isn't, I will find it weird...

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, interesting... We'll find out from after what that is, Carlisia... But first of all, Angelica, it's your guess... Can you get it? What's the most useful Go package in the standard library?

**Angelica Hill:** It's a little pressure...

**Mat Ryer:** You still have all three points...

**Angelica Hill:** I mean, my first thought is math, just because I stopped doing math when I was 16, so I find that very useful, because I can't do any of that... Mark is giving me a weird look... \[laughs\] Um, maybe math... I think I'll go with math, as my teammates cry on the side...

**Mat Ryer:** Math, okay. Gophers say... \[fail sound\] No, it's not that. You lose a life. But don't worry, you've got two lives left. And Erik, it's your turn to guess this last one. If you lose all three lives, of course, remember that the other team gets an opportunity to steal this board.

**Erik St. Martin:** Based on usage, I think it's gonna be strings.

**Mat Ryer:** Strings. Gophers say... \[fail sound\] No, I'm afraid not. You lose a life, and you have one life left. That life is in the hands of Natalie Pistunovich. Natalie, what's the final one?

**Natalie Pistunovich:** Do I get to confer?

**Mat Ryer:** No, I'm afraid not. You'll have to just do it all on your own.

**Erik St. Martin:** What would this be...?

**Mat Ryer:** What do you think, Natalie?

**Natalie Pistunovich:** I actually am gonna go with Angelica's hunch...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Go with archive...

**Natalie Pistunovich:** Log.

**Mat Ryer:** Log. Okay, this is it, your last life... Let's see if you get the board or give the other team a chance to steal. Is log on the board? Gophers say... \[fail sound\] No, I'm afraid not... So you can confer... Team 2 has a chance to steal.

**Carlisia Thompson:** It's errors.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah, I think it's either errors or database.

**Carlisia Thompson:** No, it's errors.

**Brian Ketelsen:** That's because everybody's been reading Mark Bates code. \[laughter\]

**Carlisia Thompson:** It's errors.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah, I'd agree. I'd say errors. If we're gonna fail, let's fail anonymously.

**Kris Brandow:** Sure.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Before we move on, does anyone else want to be mean to Mark? Because that felt good for me...

**Natalie Pistunovich:** I want to agree with the other team. I think it's a good answer.

**Mat Ryer:** What was the answer then?

**Carlisia Thompson:** Errors.

**Mat Ryer:** Errors. Let's see. Gophers say... \[fail sound\]

**Carlisia Thompson:** Okay, okay. I'm outta here.

**Kris Brandow:** Is it database SQL?

**Erik St. Martin:** That's what I think it is.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** That's what I was thinking.

**Mark Bates:** Can I take a guess?

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah.

**Mark Bates:** I think it could be the sync package.

**Carlisia Thompson:** No...

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, interesting. The points are gonna be awarded already, and let's have a look, what was that final one at number five... The most useful Go package was indeed sync.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Oh, wow.

**Mat Ryer:** Yes, five people said that.

**Mark Bates:** Well, you can't go concurrency in Go without it...

**Carlisia Thompson:** Wait, what's in the sync package? I don't think I've ever used it... \[laughter\] What am I missing?

**Erik St. Martin:** That's where Mutex and WaitGroup and everything --

**Johnny Boursiquot:** You're missing some synchronization.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Okay, yup.

**Mat Ryer:** Sync was a favorite of mine. I think that's a cracking little function...

**Mark Bates:** It's an incredibly useful package, the sync package, I would say...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, it's very good, isn't it? We have time -- if we want to, we have a bonus round, if you wanna keep going, one more round... Shall we do it?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** \[01:04:06.12\] Let's do a bonus round.

**Kris Brandow:** Let's go!

**Carlisia Thompson:** Yup.

**Mat Ryer:** Let's do it then, okay. Okay, so please nominate, who's gonna go head to head to decide who controls the board?

**Kris Brandow:** Oh, Lord...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** What is this...?

**Carlisia Thompson:** Oh, I don't wanna touch this one. I'm sitting this one out.

**Mat Ryer:** The question is, which popular development practice would you like to outlaw.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** There's gonna be some hot takes on this one.

**Mat Ryer:** There's gonna be a lot of hot takes.

**Mark Bates:** Oh, let me go. I have one.

**Angelica Hill:** Go, Mark...

**Mat Ryer:** Are you happy, team 1?

**Kris Brandow:** Okay...

**Carlisia Thompson:** Hang yourself, Mark...

**Mat Ryer:** Okay. Who from team two is gonna go head to head with Mark?

**Kris Brandow:** Brian?

**Brian Ketelsen:** Anybody have anything good? I've got one.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I don't...

**Kris Brandow:** I don't...

**Mat Ryer:** Sounds like it's you then, Brian...

**Brian Ketelsen:** Alright.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I think it's Brian...

**Carlisia Thompson:** Alright, I have one.

**Brian Ketelsen:** Oh, you've got one?

**Carlisia Thompson:** Yeah.

**Brian Ketelsen:** Okay, go.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Me first?

**Mat Ryer:** Yes, it is you first, Carlisia. What do you think?

**Carlisia Thompson:** Agile.

**Mat Ryer:** Agile, what a good answer. Let's see if it's on the board...

**Angelica Hill:** That's a terrible answer...

**Mat Ryer:** \[win sound\] \[laughter\] Indeed, it's on the board... At number one.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Number one, baby.

**Mat Ryer:** 14 people at number one said they'd like to outlaw Agile, Scrum or sprints.

**Angelica Hill:** Shot straight to my heart... That hurts me to my core.

**Carlisia Thompson:** It wasn't me who said it; it was them.

**Erik St. Martin:** She's not speaking her own thoughts, just guessing what other people are saying...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** She just channeled it...

**Mat Ryer:** This is also double points...

**Carlisia Thompson:** For real? You would never know, but that's what I'm going with... \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, that means team 2 takes control of the board, and... Johnny, it's your turn to take the next guess.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** This is a tough one...

**Mat Ryer:** It sure is.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Can I confer with my teammates?

**Mat Ryer:** No.

**Natalie Pistunovich:** It won't help you. The product manager is in our team. \[laughter\]

**Johnny Boursiquot:** A popular development practice you wanna outlaw...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, we've got four items on the board. Agile at number one has already been taken. Two, three and four still up for grabs, double points available... What do you think, Johnny?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** And this is gonna be an unpopular opinion rolled into it... TDD.

**Mat Ryer:** TDD... That is an unpopular opinion. Is it on the board? Gophers say... \[win sound\]

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Holy smokes...

**Brian Ketelsen:** Good job... \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** At number two.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Listen up... There are like four development practices; we're just gonna go through one by one and that's it.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Well, we don't want any of them as a community, as an industry?

**Carlisia Thompson:** No, I'm just saying, four is all there is. So we'll just list them.

**Mat Ryer:** Maybe so... Let's find out. It's Kris' turn next to have a guess. No conferring, please. Kris, which popular development practice would our Gophers like to outlaw, do you think?

**Kris Brandow:** I'm gonna say continuous delivery.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, continuous delivery. CI/CD.

**Kris Brandow:** CI/CD.

**Mat Ryer:** Gophers say... \[fail sound\]

**Carlisia Thompson:** No, no...

**Mat Ryer:** No, they didn't say that.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** That would be really controversial.

**Mat Ryer:** So you lose a life, but that's okay. Two lives left.

**Kris Brandow:** I mean, people wanna get rid of TDD, so...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I know. I don't get why TDD is on here. This is ridiculous.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Who...? Give me their names...

**Mat Ryer:** Brian.

**Kris Brandow:** Well, Carlisia -- oh, Brian's up.

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Brian, it's your turn next. Do you have a guess?

**Carlisia Thompson:** I have an idea... Is it time to confer? If it is, I have an idea.

**Mat Ryer:** No, not yet. Soon though. Brian, what do you think?

**Brian Ketelsen:** Pair programming.

**Kris Brandow:** Oh, that's a good one.

**Mat Ryer:** Gophers say... \[win sound\] Yes, indeed.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Boom. Boom.

**Mat Ryer:** It's on there, and it's at number four. Five people said they'd like to outlaw pair programming. They sound very social, those people... \[unintelligible 01:07:35.17\] If you don't like it, it's fine. That's good, ain't it? Oh, it's going well... So we've got 1, 2 and 4 taken; it just leaves number 3 to guess. Carlisia, it's your turn. Can you guess what's the final one? Two lives left...

**Carlisia Thompson:** I have an idea, but is it time to confer?

**Kris Brandow:** No...

**Carlisia Thompson:** No? Okay.

**Mat Ryer:** Just on your own, mate.

**Carlisia Thompson:** \[01:08:01.13\] Don't repeat yourself.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, I love that answer. DRY programming. Is it up there? Gophers say... \[fail sound\]

**Carlisia Thompson:** It's alright.

**Mat Ryer:** I'm afraid not. Good answer though.

**Carlisia Thompson:** They don't know better. \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** You still have one life left... And it's, of course, Johnny. Back around to Johnny. Johnny, final life...

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Goodness. Wow, I'm getting all the hard ones.

**Mat Ryer:** Which popular development practice would you like to outlaw? We asked 100 Gophers which they would like to outlaw... What did they say?

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Wait, I can't confer?

**Mat Ryer:** No, I'm afraid not.

**Erik St. Martin:** Only during a steal.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** I will say -- I'll throw my hands up there and say extreme programming.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, extreme programming. Gophers say... \[fail sound\] No, I'm afraid not. And that's your three lives expired... Which means it's an opportunity to steal. So you can confer now, everybody else, to steal these points, in team 1. Erik, Natalie, Mark, Angelica... What do you think could be the final answer?

**Mark Bates:** What do people think about coding tests during interviews...?

**Natalie Pistunovich:** I don't know if that is a development practice...

**Mark Bates:** Yeah, have we seen the rest of the answers...?

**Natalie Pistunovich:** How about reviews?

**Angelica Hill:** Well, that's fine...

**Natalie Pistunovich:** Pull requests.

**Erik St. Martin:** Yeah, I wonder if it's something like software development lifecycle-related, but we're talking like waterfall, or Kanban, or something... Or whether it's like a configuration management infrastructure as code...

**Angelica Hill:** Test coverage being 100%...

**Mat Ryer:** I don't know the answer, so hopefully you're not trying to read my--

**Erik St. Martin:** Didn't you know? I love studying body language. We've already figured it out.

**Mat Ryer:** Oh... What is it then?

**Mark Bates:** Kanban is not a bad choice... I'm still sticking to my coding tests, because that is unfortunately a popular practice in the development world... And these questions do get conflated with other things, as we've seen...

**Erik St. Martin:** Yeah... And interviews - I don't know whether people confuse it.

**Natalie Pistunovich:** I'm also not sure.

**Erik St. Martin:** Maybe code reviews, or something...

**Natalie Pistunovich:** Yeah, code reviews is almost as ingrained as Agile stuff... \[laughter\]

**Mark Bates:** But semantic import versioning in modules count as something we'd like to outlaw? \[laughter\]

**Kris Brandow:** Adding some spice to this...

**Mark Bates:** Is that a really unpopular opinion? Should I not have said that...?

**Mat Ryer:** You can say what you like, mate. Go Time is the Wild West. Actually, I'd love an answer... Erik?

**Erik St. Martin:** Alright... Who feels really confident about their answer? Because with the answers to all of these questions, I'm not feeling so confident...

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah. Code reviews - that's such a vital one, but recently I've been put off with that when \[unintelligible 01:10:44.23\] destroyed my reputation reviewing my code just then... \[laughter\]

**Natalie Pistunovich:** It's true.

**Erik St. Martin:** Could this even just be meetings? \[laughs\]

**Angelica Hill:** I mean, maybe...

**Mat Ryer:** Would people say that, I guess, if you asked "What popular development practice would you like to outlaw?"

**Natalie Pistunovich:** I'd say we say code reviews, or pull requests, slash, slash, slash, etc...

**Angelica Hill:** Yeah. All clumped together.

**Brian Ketelsen:** E.g, i.e..

**Erik St. Martin:** I agree, I think that's what it's gonna be.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, Erik, so what's your final answer, please?

**Erik St. Martin:** Let's go with code reviews. We've got enough points anyway. \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, code reviews to steal the board... Gophers say... \[fail sound\] No, I'm afraid not. It has been said, the answer...

**Angelica Hill:** Oh, no...

**Mat Ryer:** Why don't we just quickly go around, each person, and you can have one final guess each? Starting with Johnny.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Big design upfront.

**Mat Ryer:** Big design upfront?

**Kris Brandow:** I don't think anybody said that.

**Carlisia Thompson:** No, Johnny, it has been said. And that has not been said before.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Really?

**Carlisia Thompson:** Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** The answer was waterfall, 64.

**Erik St. Martin:** That was the first thing I thought...

**Kris Brandow:** I'm sorry, like -- popular? Is waterfall really popular? \[laughs\]

**Mark Bates:** I didn't realize people are still doing waterfall...

**Carlisia Thompson:** I was gonna say, you can't outlaw something that has already been outlawed...

**Brian Ketelsen:** \[01:12:01.03\] Why are there 64 respondents and only 12 points for that?

**Mat Ryer:** I think that is a very good question, Brian...

**Kris Brandow:** Jerod...! \[laughter\]

**Mat Ryer:** Let me get some clarity on that. We'll find out...

**Mark Bates:** It does feel like waterfall would be at the very top of that list...

**Erik St. Martin:** Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** It may be.

**Mark Bates:** With 65 responses, and all...

**Jerod Santo:** It was a typo. It was six.

**Kris Brandow:** Oh, it's six. Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** I typo-ed the number. It's six.

**Brian Ketelsen:** I think we should win by default.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Yeah.

**Mat Ryer:** Okay, so six people said waterfall... So we had at number one Agile, number two was TDD, BDD or DDD, waterfall at number three, and pair programming at number four. I wouldn't necessarily have answered those that same way... Would you? Very interesting.

Okay, so let's have a look at the final scores. Team 2, 164 points... But team 1 taking the lead and the prize, which is nothing... You had 341 points. Congratulations to team 1. \[applause\]

So that's it. That comes to the end -- oh, some other interesting answers to this before we move on... Somebody said "Never going to v1" was something they would like to outlaw. Somebody wrote "Disagreeing with me specifically." \[laughter\] That's quite an interesting answer there...

**Mark Bates:** Again, I'm gonna say, I think I was in that survey... Disqualified...

**Mat Ryer:** Meetings was mentioned...

**Mark Bates:** These sound a lot like my responses, in a lot of cases...

**Mat Ryer:** Did you actually answer the survey, Mark?

**Mark Bates:** Nah.

**Mat Ryer:** No, you didn't. Good. Thank you. Yeah... Just because it's hard to separate out the joke from the lie sometimes, with you...

**Mark Bates:** Well, they're all pretty much one and the same. Joke and lie, they're all--

**Mat Ryer:** Yeah, exactly. What's the difference these days...? Post-truth world. Being super-clever was another answer that we got, so we want to outlaw being super-clever from --

**Carlisia Thompson:** Being super-clever is not a development practice... \[laughter\]

**Natalie Pistunovich:** The famous developer practice of being \[unintelligible 01:13:56.01\] That's probably what they meant.

**Carlisia Thompson:** But I like where your head is at, dude... Whoever said that.

**Mark Bates:** I think that means like a meta-programming kind of thing, is what they'd like to outlaw, more than being clever. I think a better term would say "Outlaw meta-programming." You know, the Ruby stuff that you couldn't ever grep for your codebase...

**Kris Brandow:** Yeah. I feel like hackathon should be on here \[unintelligible 01:14:17.09\]

**Mat Ryer:** So let's have the lovely opinions...

**Carlisia Thompson:** Duck typing for programming should be outlawed... \[laughs\]

**Mark Bates:** 80 character limits on the line length.

**Mat Ryer:** Come on then, keep going; what do you hate? It's a therapy session now. Just get it off your chest. \[laughter\]

**Mark Bates:** I like spaces! I'm not gonna lie!

**Mat Ryer:** I love spaces. My dad just replying with one-word answers.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Not having a color-coded terminal should be outlawed.

**Mat Ryer:** Well...

**Kris Brandow:** Hm... Spicy.

**Mat Ryer:** Well, we're way over time, but wasn't it worth it? Thank you so much for joining us on our special 200th episode. Two hundreDTH... Can anyone say that?

**Kris Brandow:** Two hundreth?

**Erik St. Martin:** Two hundreth?

**Carlisia Thompson:** Yes, we can.

**Erik St. Martin:** I think you leave out the d.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Nobody has a problem with that, mate.

**Kris Brandow:** It's just you.

**Mat Ryer:** You're not saying the d.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** It's just you, Mat...

**Erik St. Martin:** Two hundredth...

**Mat Ryer:** Two hundreDTH. You've gotta say that d.

**Kris Brandow:** Two hundreth.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Nope. Still wrong, Mat.

**Carlisia Thompson:** Even I can.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** There's no d there, what is wrong with you?

**Mat Ryer:** Is it not?

**Natalie Pistunovich:** Two hundreth?

**Mark Bates:** You could say it's ten score, if you really wanted to... \[laughter\] It's an alternate way of getting you the same way, the same math...

**Mat Ryer:** I can say that. I wish I'd thought of that.

**Johnny Boursiquot:** He's been in graduate school for too long...

**Mark Bates:** I'm trying to bring score back. You know, two score and five... I don't mind admitting that.

**Erik St. Martin:** Two score in four episodes ago... \[laughter\]

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Fortnightly... Yeah, you'll listen to this episode in a fortnightly time period... \[laughter\]

**Mark Bates:** Isn't it a fun language...?

**Mat Ryer:** Oh, isn't it? Yeah, I've had lots of fun...

**Mark Bates:** \[unintelligible 01:15:45.03\] fortnight, that's for sure.

**Mat Ryer:** True. Just put two w. Okay - well, I wanna say thank you again so much for coming... Brian Ketelsen, Erik St. Martin, Carlisia Thompson - the OG Go Time; it's great back together and hang out. I really do mean that, so thank you so much. And also, we had Natalie Pistunovich, Kris Brandow, Angelica Hill, Johnny Boursiquot, and of course, Mark Bates. I was Mat Ryer... Thank you so much. Tell all your friends about Go Time if you want... See you later. Bye!

**Carlisia Thompson:** Bye, everyone.

**Erik St. Martin:** Bye!

**Johnny Boursiquot:** Byee!
