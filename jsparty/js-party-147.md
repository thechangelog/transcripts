**Jerod Santo:** Hello, and welcome to our very first - and maybe only - episode of Frontend Feud here on JS Party. I'm Jerod, I'm your friend, and I'm here with two awesome teams. They're gonna battle out to win absolutely nothing. On my left it's team Emma...

**Emma Bostian:** What's our team name now? Come on...

**Jerod Santo:** And your team name is?

**Emma Bostian:** The Hypertext Assassins.

**Jerod Santo:** The Hypertext Assassins. Joining Emma is Abenezer and Nick. Good luck, fellas! And on my right it's team Kball...

**Kevin Ball:** Hello, hello.

**Jerod Santo:** Kball, what's your team name?

**Kevin Ball:** We are the DSL Destroyers. Or if you prefer, the Diesel Destroyers.

**Jerod Santo:** Oooh... I do prefer. Joining Kball on the Diesel Destroyers is Ali and Mikeal. Good luck! Alright. Well, with that, let's begin our first round. We're gonna call up the two team captains for round one. Emma versus Kball. Now, I will name the question, you will buzz in verbally, however you deem appropriate, and you will answer what you think is the most answered response. We surveyed 112 JS Party listeners, and the one who gets the highest response wins the board. Are you ready?

**Kevin Ball:** Sure. Wait... As the newb to Feud-like things - do we have to ask in a Jeopardy manner, like "What is..." whatever? Or just say it.

**Emma Bostian:** No. I mean, sure... Why not? \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** You can... But unless you think most people who took the survey answered in a question, I would not advise it. Okay... Just let Emma go first on this one, Kball; you'll learn the ropes. \[laughter\] Alright, are you ready? Name a JavaScript function that most frontenders know.

**Emma Bostian:** Buzz...

**Jerod Santo:** Emma has buzzed in.

**Emma Bostian:** \`Array.forEach( )\` ?

**Jerod Santo:** I'm sorry, that is not on the list.

**Nick Nisi:** A JavaScript function... That's so broad.

**Kevin Ball:** Buzz.

**Jerod Santo:** Kball.

**Kevin Ball:** I didn't buzz. Somebody buzzed for me.

**Mikeal Rogers:** I buzzed.

**Jerod Santo:** You're not up, man. It's Kball's turn. \[laughter\]

**Mikeal Rogers:** Oh, I thought that it was the whole team.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, so he's up to win the board, and then his team will full partake... So hold on there, even though you know the answer. Kball, name a JavaScript function that most frontenders know.

**Kevin Ball:** Hm... \`encodeURIComponent( )\`.

**Jerod Santo:** \[fail sound\] You're making this way harder than it needs to be... \[laughter\] Back to Emma. Emma, please name a JavaScript -- you already know the question. What have you got?

**Emma Bostian:** How about \`addEventListener( )\`? \[fail sound\] I don't know... This is such a weird question, Jerod.

**Jerod Santo:** We've surveyed 112 JS Party listeners... 27 of them said the exact same thing. Kball, what is a JavaScript function that most frontenders know? Frontend Feud off to a hot start... \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** Can you at least tell us if either one of us was like hot?

**Mikeal Rogers:** You know, jQuery is technically a function...

**Jerod Santo:** No. Cold. You were both very cold. Well, those were answered by a few people, but not on the top five answers. So...

**Kevin Ball:** I guess that is a good point. So it doesn't have to be a built-in function. So let's go with jQuery. \[fail sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** Nope. Not jQuery. \[laughter\] It doesn't bode well for the rest of the game... Here we are... Emma.

**Emma Bostian:** You should give us the bottom answer so we know what general things we're looking for. Because this is really hard. Just saying.

**Jerod Santo:** You're definitely in the right range, you're naming functions. \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** Okay, fine. We're gonna keep going.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Emma Bostian:** How about \`window.setTimeout( )\`? \[fail sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** You're getting more obscure. Try to get less obscure. \[laughter\]

**Mikeal Rogers:** setTimeout is not obscure... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Good point.

**Kevin Ball:** A JavaScript function... No hints about like is it scoped, or on an object, or anything like that. Hm...

**Emma Bostian:** No, you don't get a hint if I don't get a hint. That ain't fair.

**Kevin Ball:** Did you already do four each?

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** She did. That one is somewhat close, I guess, if you wanna play hot or cold... You're warm.

**Kevin Ball:** Alright, let's say map. \`Array.map( )\`. \[win sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** That is correct! 27 people said \`Array.map( )\`, so Kball, there are now five answers on the board. You've given one of them. Your team has three chances to name the other four, at which point you get all the points. Or you can pass it to the other team and make them try to answer these. What would you like to do?

**Kevin Ball:** Given how this started, I'm gonna pass.

**Jerod Santo:** You're gonna pass, okay. So team Emma is going to play the board, and we're gonna start with Abenezer, because Emma has had plenty of guesses already. Abenezer, name a JavaScript function that most frontenders know.

**Abenezer Abebe:** \`getElementById( )\`? \[win sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** Correct. Four people answered with \`getElementById( )\`.

**Emma Bostian:** Hell yes! Sweden for the win!

**Jerod Santo:** You have two of the five. There's three left on the board; slots 2, 3 and 4 are still wide open. Nick, your turn.

**Nick Nisi:** I will go with \`querySelector( )\`. \[win sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** \`querySelector( )\` is on there. That's the number four answer. Five people answered \`querySelector( )\`. You're off to a much better start than your team captain... Speaking of - Emma, it's your turn.

**Emma Bostian:** How about \`getElementsByClassName( )\`? \[fail sound\] Ah, for f\*\*\*\* sake! \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Careful there...

**Emma Bostian:** I caught myself...

**Abenezer Abebe:** Think about the kids... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** That's right. Think about the kids. Abenezer, back to you. You have one strike. There's two strikes left; there's two more answers on the board, number two and number three.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Geez... So the question is still the same, right? It's a popular JavaScript function.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, that's right.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Geez... Yeah, I should have been thinking... I thought I got by. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** It loops around. It's a while loop.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Yeah, cool... Let's go with...

**Emma Bostian:** You've just gotta guess, sir. We'll run out of time.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Yeah, I'll go with -- geez, this is really hard...

**Jerod Santo:** You're stalling.

**Emma Bostian:** I mean, you can pass if you really can't think of anything.

**Abenezer Abebe:** It's hard to think when you're on the spot. I'm gonna pass, yeah. \[fail sound\]

**Emma Bostian:** I know.

**Jerod Santo:** That's a wrong answer. Alright, two strikes, Nick. You can save the team here.

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, no...

**Jerod Santo:** There's two left.

**Nick Nisi:** Okay... You said not obscure, but I'm gonna go with reduce anyway.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Nice. \[fail sound\] Oh, wow...

**Emma Bostian:** That was a solid guess.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, that is three strikes.

**Emma Bostian:** Solid guess, Nick.

**Jerod Santo:** Now, team Kball - the Diesel Destroyers - you can now confirm amongst yourselves; you can steal the board by naming one of the two remaining answers. There's two left on the board.

**Mikeal Rogers:** And we can discuss it, right?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, go ahead and discuss.

**Kevin Ball:** I feel like the guesses that we were making upfront - Jerod was saying we were in the right ballpark, and we could only hit number one on those ones... So I'm guessing \`Array.forEach( )\` is probably in there still. What do you all think?

**Ali Spittel:** No, I think it's in the top five--

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, if it's in the top five...

**Ali Spittel:** Any of the top five would have been right.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right. It has to be in the top five.

**Kevin Ball:** Wait, wait, wait... When Emma and I were head-to-head - any in the top five? Or we were just going for number one?

**Emma Bostian:** No, any of the top five.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, you were missing all of them.

**Mikeal Rogers:** I'm a little bit torn right now between a couple... So the ones that I think it may be are \`toString( )\`, because it's all over the place, and pretty obvious... And then the JSON methods for stringify and parse.

**Ali Spittel:** Oh, interesting. \`parseInt( )\` would be another interesting one... Or filter.

**Mikeal Rogers:** Yeah...

**Ali Spittel:** Because map was the top one.

**Kevin Ball:** And we get one guess to steal?

**Jerod Santo:** You get one guess. There's two out there. Either one will win it for you.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Wow.

**Mikeal Rogers:** There's like a section of people that are into arrays and functional programming on arrays, and their favorite is always map. So I feel like they've just self-selected into doing map.

**Kevin Ball:** We've got that. Yeah. And if \[unintelligible 00:09:35.19\]

**Mikeal Rogers:** Especially if reduce wasn't there, right? Like, if reduce wasn't there, then - hm...

**Ali Spittel:** It's true.

**Emma Bostian:** Just saying, there's a time limit on this consultation...

**Jerod Santo:** Yes.

**Mikeal Rogers:** Okay.

**Kevin Ball:** I like either \`parseInt( )\` or \`JSON.stringify( )\`.

**Ali Spittel:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Cool. Which one?

**Ali Spittel:** Either one.

**Mikeal Rogers:** \`JSON.stringify( )\` I think is probably more likely.

**Kevin Ball:** Let's go with it. \`JSON.stringify( )\`. \[fail sound\] Aww...! Was it \`parseInt( )\`?

**Jerod Santo:** I will say that both \`JSON.stringify( )\` and \`parseInt( )\` had been answered, but they were all with one point. Not enough. You're probably gonna kick yourself... The number two answer, with 24 answers, is \`console.log( )\`. \[laughter\]

**Mikeal Rogers:** Of course.

**Jerod Santo:** And the number three answer, with seven responses, was alert.

**Mikeal Rogers:** Oh, wow. I haven't used alert in forever.

**Emma Bostian:** To be fair, Jerod, my first original answer was so close... I just want credit for that, because...

**Jerod Santo:** \`forEach( )\`?

**Emma Bostian:** Was that my first one?

**Jerod Santo:** It was pretty good. Pretty good. There were a couple of forEach'es out there. I think it was just underneath the threshold of being on the board. So after round one, what happened was team Emma managed to hang on to their 36 points that they scored during round one. So now we move to round two, and we call up to the front Abenezer and Ali. Are you two ready?

**Ali Spittel:** Yeah.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Yes.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Name a place where frontenders go to write code.

**Ali Spittel:** Buzz.

**Jerod Santo:** Ali has buzzed in.

**Ali Spittel:** Their text editor, or like VS Code. \[win sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** That is the number five answer, with six responses. So you're on the board, but Abenezer gets a chance to also answer. If he can score higher than that, then he wins the board.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Cafe.

**Jerod Santo:** Cafe... \[win sound\] Number one answer!

**Emma Bostian:** Oh!

**Nick Nisi:** Nice...

**Emma Bostian:** I wasn't expecting that. I was expecting to be more like software.

**Mikeal Rogers:** I was thinking virtual space, too.

**Ali Spittel:** Yeah, I think we had wildly different \[unintelligible 00:11:47.09\] on this...

**Jerod Santo:** Wildly different answers. \[unintelligible 00:11:47.22\] That's right. 26 people answered coffee shop, or cafe, or Starbucks. That was your number one answer. So there's six answers total on the board. Two of them have already been taken, since you've both hit them, and Abenezer won the board, so your team can now play it or pass it. What would you like to do?

**Emma Bostian:** It's up to you, sir.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Do I have to decide, or can I confer?

**Jerod Santo:** Your team can decide.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, go for it. Why not.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Do you wanna do it? Alright.

**Nick Nisi:** Play it.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Yeah, we can play it.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, they're playing. So we move next to Nick. Nick, name a place where frontenders go to write code.

**Nick Nisi:** Their basement. \[fail sound\] \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Valiant guess.

**Mikeal Rogers:** That's backend, not frontend. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Oh...! Yikes. I will say that somebody did answer with that, but it did not make the top six. So we move to Emma. That's one strike.

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, my gosh...

**Mikeal Rogers:** I say that as a backend developer, by the way.

**Jerod Santo:** Good save.

**Emma Bostian:** How about their bed? \[fail sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** It's getting weirder...

**Emma Bostian:** I will type code in bed...!

**Jerod Santo:** I will say that one was also an answer...

**Emma Bostian:** Thank you!

**Jerod Santo:** ...but not good enough to make the board... Which means it's back to Abenezer. You now have two strikes.

**Kevin Ball:** We're learning about each of you here.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes.

**Mikeal Rogers:** Oh, man...

**Jerod Santo:** You have two strikes against you, and there's four answers left on the board.

**Abenezer Abebe:** So where developers go to write code.

**Jerod Santo:** I'll remind you that the people that took the survey answered the exact same phrase that I'm reading to you: "Name a place where frontenders go to write code." That's what they saw.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Alright. My answer is gonna be "Work." \[win sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** Number four answer. Very good. Worth nine points. So now they have three left on the board. You have the number two, the number three and the number six still out there for you. Nick, it's your turn, last strike right here.

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, no...

**Jerod Santo:** What have you got?

**Nick Nisi:** A place where frontenders go to write code... I don't know. I'll say CodeSandbox. \[win sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** Number six answer. Very good!

**Abenezer Abebe:** Well done.

**Jerod Santo:** Six people responded with CodeSandbox. Now we are down to two left, and one strike left. Emma, it's your turn.

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, my gosh... Well, given that he's just said CodeSandbox, I guess I'll go for CodePen. \[win sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** Number two answer.

**Kevin Ball:** Darn it. I had that in reserve.

**Jerod Santo:** CodePen, worth 23 points. We are now down to just one response on the board, and one strike left. Abenezer, it's all in your hands.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Geez. Not again. One strike left - alright, I will go with... This is probably old. JSFiddle. \[fail sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** I'm sorry, that is incorrect.

**Emma Bostian:** That was a good answer though...

**Jerod Santo:** Good answer. Now we go to team Kball. Same as last time around - you have a chance to steal. Confer amongst yourselves... Take less time than the last time, and go ahead and give me an answer, please.

**Mikeal Rogers:** Quick question, Jerod - how much liberty did you take in combining answers that were similar to each other?

**Jerod Santo:** If they were similar enough, I combined them. So work and office, I put those together.

**Mikeal Rogers:** Okay. That was my exact question.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. IDE and editor - I put those together. Coffee shop and Starbucks... So if they were logically the same thing, but they were just different, then I combined them.

**Mikeal Rogers:** I feel like we're gonna be out of physical places then, and it's just all digital now. Glitch maybe?

**Kevin Ball:** Glitch is an interesting one. Or I was even just thinking the browser.

**Ali Spittel:** That's what I was thinking, too. The browser console.

**Mikeal Rogers:** Repl, in general?

**Kevin Ball:** I don't think frontenders tend to think of it as Repl, but...

**Mikeal Rogers:** Right.

**Jerod Santo:** Backender over there...

**Mikeal Rogers:** Good call.

**Jerod Santo:** So you're thinking browser? Is that your answer? What's your answer?

**Kevin Ball:** What do you think? How do you feel about it, Ali?

**Ali Spittel:** Yeah, I think it's good.

**Kevin Ball:** Alright, let's go with the browser. \[fail sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** I'm sorry, that is incorrect.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Wow... I thought you had it.

**Jerod Santo:** The number three response with ten answers was GitHub.

**Emma Bostian:** I was gonna guess that, but then I'm like "There's no way..."

**Ali Spittel:** Who writes code on GitHub...? \[laughs\]

**Mikeal Rogers:** I was thinking that, yeah.

**Kevin Ball:** Who writes code on GitHub?!

**Abenezer Abebe:** I mean, I do, but I don't talk about it...

**Jerod Santo:** "I do, but I don't talk about it..."

**Mikeal Rogers:** I write code on GitHub all the time... \[laughter\]

**Abenezer Abebe:** Yeah, I do too, but it's not something I share...

**Ali Spittel:** Only markdown... \[laughs\]

**Mikeal Rogers:** It's code spaces now. That's a totally valid answer.

**Ali Spittel:** Oh, true.

**Jerod Santo:** Good point.

**Mikeal Rogers:** No, but -- I mean, I write full-on patches sometimes... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** The truth comes out...

**Mikeal Rogers:** If you have good enough tests in there in Actions, why not.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. Alright, that concludes round two. Team Emma, the -- what's your name, the Assassins?

**Emma Bostian:** Hypertext Assassins.

**Jerod Santo:** The Hypertext Assassins have won both the first two rounds, and they have currently 106 points. Team Kball sitting at zero.

**Break:** \[00:16:41.01\]

**Jerod Santo:** Let's move now to round three. We're gonna call up Nick and Mikeal. Are you guys ready?

**Nick Nisi:** Please be frontend, please be frontend...

**Mikeal Rogers:** Yes.

**Jerod Santo:** This is a fun one... Remember to buzz in and name your answer. Name a style of music people listen to while programming.

**Mikeal Rogers:** Buzz.

**Jerod Santo:** Mikeal has buzzed in.

**Mikeal Rogers:** EDM.

**Jerod Santo:** EDM. \[win sound\] Number three answer, so Nick still has a chance at it.

**Nick Nisi:** I'll say -- what's it called...? Dubstep. \[fail sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** Dubstep did not make the list. So Mikeal has won the board. Team Kball gets to play for the first time... Or you can pass it back to team Emma. What would you like to do?

**Mikeal Rogers:** \[unintelligible 00:18:24.23\]

**Jerod Santo:** There's four answers on the board.

**Mikeal Rogers:** I feel like we haven't played it yet, so we should play it.

**Kevin Ball:** I know, we've gotta play.

**Mikeal Rogers:** We have to play it.

**Emma Bostian:** Just so you know, two of us work at Spotify, so... \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, yeah. Disclaimer.

**Mikeal Rogers:** This is not fair.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, totally not fair.

**Kevin Ball:** Well, at least there's one on each team, right?

**Ali Spittel:** It's balanced.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, exactly.

**Mikeal Rogers:** Are podcasts a genre of music?

**Jerod Santo:** Good question. \[laughter\] So Mikeal won the board. Kball, that means it's your turn. There's three strikes, and you have three answers left on the board.

**Mikeal Rogers:** Jerod, can you repeat the question again? I just wanna know the exact wording.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes. Name a style of music people listen to while programming.

**Kevin Ball:** And Mikeal, you said EDM?

**Mikeal Rogers:** EDM.

**Jerod Santo:** Correct.

**Kevin Ball:** Let's go with jazz. \[fail sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** There were a few jazz answers, but not enough to make the top four.

**Emma Bostian:** Jerod, can I make a request, and if everyone agrees, can we adopt it, where like if someone gives you an answer that you've already grouped in with another answer that's on the board, can you just let us know and let them go again? Because I feel like that wouldn't be fair... You know what I mean?

**Jerod Santo:** Sure.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, we go to Ali.

**Ali Spittel:** I wanna go with classical. \[win sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** Number four answer.

**Emma Bostian:** Nice!

**Jerod Santo:** Seven responses, classical. So you have two of the four. You have the bottom two. We still have the number one and number two answers, and there's two strikes left. Kball - your turn. No, it's Mikeal.

**Kevin Ball:** It's gotta be Mikeal.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, Mikeal's turn.

**Mikeal Rogers:** I'm gonna go with hip hop. \[fail sound\] What?!

**Jerod Santo:** Sorry...

**Mikeal Rogers:** Who else does not listen to Wu-Tang while they write code? Come on.

**Kevin Ball:** Okay.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Exactly.

**Kevin Ball:** I have long learned that I am abnormal, but I'm out of ideas, so I'm gonna go with what I listen to when I write code... Reggaeton. \[fail sound\] \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** That was a very specific answer... Isn't that a style of pasta? \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** That's rigatoni, I think...

**Emma Bostian:** I know, I'm kidding... \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Kevin Ball:** Y'all are missing out, that's all I'm gonna say.

**Jerod Santo:** One person did say reggae... And I'm wondering, Kball, did you take this survey? \[laughter\]

**Kevin Ball:** No. And there is a substantial difference between reggae and reggaeton.

**Jerod Santo:** See, that's \[unintelligible 00:20:29.00\] I don't even know the difference, so I have no taste there in that place. Okay, so chance to steal... Didn't mean to laugh at you, Kball.

**Kevin Ball:** Y'all are just missing out.

**Mikeal Rogers:** No, I think it's great; it's just I wouldn't have assumed that anyone else was--

**Kevin Ball:** There's room for huge expansion here. \[laughs\] No, I was just out of ideas. I was like "What do I listen to? I listen to reggaeton." J Balvin, man. All the time.

**Jerod Santo:** So team Emma, you now have a chance to steal. You have the top two answers left.

**Emma Bostian:** I have ideas... Hold on, we need to confer. I'm guessing either Low-Fi, so like beat kind of music, with some kind of a melody, or white noise.

**Abenezer Abebe:** I was thinking the same.

**Nick Nisi:** Yeah, same. I was thinking either nothing, or white noise, or ambient sounds.

**Emma Bostian:** Should we try ambient sounds first then, and see if...?

**Abenezer Abebe:** Yeah, I guess they would be grouped together, like white noise in train stations, and... Yeah.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** I'll say that that is groups into one -- ah, how do I do this... It's sort of correct.

**Nick Nisi:** What's the best kind of correct?

**Kevin Ball:** I think Emma's rule might cause for this to not work.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. \[fail sound\] I'm gonna go ahead and say wrong. Sorry, it wasn't close enough. So the answers left on the board - number one was Electronic, Techno and Trance grouped together...

**Mikeal Rogers:** EDM, does it -- okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, see - I had to separate EDM as its own, because I had so many people that just said EDM, and there was 12 of them. 27 total said techno, or trance, or electronic, or house... Which I realized, once you get inside these genres, their subgenres... So the number one answer was that, 27 people. Number two was low-fi/chill beats. So you had it right on the tips of your tongues.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Yeah, but we guessed with the noise, and that definitely wasn't there.

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Emma Bostian:** Dang it...!

**Jerod Santo:** So a couple other answers that -- three people said soundtracks, which I thought was a good one... Two people said video games. Like I said, one said reggae, one said classic rock, so I thought, Nick, maybe you took the survey... And then one person did say podcasts, which - I'm all for listening to podcasts, but a) not music, and b) while you're coding? Really? Listening to podcasts?

**Mikeal Rogers:** You've gotta be trying to not answer the question if you say podcasts... Because it's a very specific genre of music.

**Jerod Santo:** Exactly, exactly.

**Nick Nisi:** I can't believe it wasn't specifically just Careless Whisper on repeat...

**Jerod Santo:** Just on repeat? \[laughter\] Friends can listen to Carless Whisper in the dark... Okay.

**Abenezer Abebe:** I dig it.

**Jerod Santo:** So that round - it goes to team Kball. Unfortunately, they only answered the bottom two, so they got 12 plus 7. They scored 19 points.

**Emma Bostian:** It was hard...

**Jerod Santo:** So now it's 106 to 19... And we move to round four, which is also our final round.

**Abenezer Abebe:** I love the music.

**Jerod Santo:** We're going back to the place we started, Emma versus Kball.

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, non-subject matter, okay. Whew!

**Jerod Santo:** No. We've moved on from functions.

**Kevin Ball:** You've \[unintelligible 00:23:25.23\] so far.

**Jerod Santo:** Name something you might bring to a frontend job interview.

**Emma Bostian:** Buzz.

**Jerod Santo:** Emma?

**Emma Bostian:** Your resume. \[win sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** Correct. Number three answer, with 13 responses. So there's still two chances for Kball to steal.

**Kevin Ball:** Your laptop.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, I didn't think that through...

**Jerod Santo:** \[win sound\] Number one answer, laptop, or computer. So Kball takes the board. Do you wanna play or pass?

**Kevin Ball:** I guess let's play.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, you are playing. You have the number one and the number three answers. There are five total, so there's three answers left on the board, and it's Ali's turn.

**Ali Spittel:** I don't know... Water. It's the only thing I can think of. \[laughs\] \[fail sound\]

**Mikeal Rogers:** The company provides water.

**Ali Spittel:** I know, but... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** If they don't, you shouldn't work there.

**Emma Bostian:** To be fair, Ali, I would have guessed that, too.

**Ali Spittel:** It's tough.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. There's definitely people that answered water, but not enough to score. Okay, going to Mikeal...

**Mikeal Rogers:** I wanna say conference T-shirt, but I'm thinking that might not be an answer that's very popular... What are things that you bring to an interview...? Useless answers to questions about B Trees?

**Kevin Ball:** Frontend interview. Frontend interview.

**Jerod Santo:** Frontend interview, that's right.

**Mikeal Rogers:** Frontend interview at Google - useless answers to questions about B Trees... \[laughter\] Yeah, I'm just gonna say conference T-shirt... Yeah, whatever. I don't have a better answer. \[fail sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** You aren't the only person that said that, but there were very few, so... That's a strike. You have two strikes against you. There's still three on the board. Back to Kball... Name something you might bring to a frontend job interview.

**Kevin Ball:** The audience here who were filling this out was our listeners...

**Jerod Santo:** That's correct.

**Kevin Ball:** ... so it's gotta be JS Party swag. \[fail sound\]

**Mikeal Rogers:** That would have been mixed in with conference T-shirt!

**Emma Bostian:** Kball...!

**Jerod Santo:** It's your own team though. I can't--

**Mikeal Rogers:** That would have been grouped in with conference T-shirt though, right?

**Jerod Santo:** Totally.

**Mikeal Rogers:** Okay.

**Emma Bostian:** Give them another answer. That was sad...

**Mikeal Rogers:** You have to, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** It's your own team.

**Mikeal Rogers:** You have to say "That would have been grouped if it would have been an answer, I think.

**Abenezer Abebe:** That was more of a plug than a good answer, wasn't it? \[laughter\]

**Kevin Ball:** Y'all have figured me out here. I'm not trying to win anymore.

**Abenezer Abebe:** I love it. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, Kball, I'll give you another shot, just because of the JS Party reference.

**Kevin Ball:** Let's see... To a frontend interview...

**Mikeal Rogers:** What are the ones that are taken again? It's laptop...

**Jerod Santo:** Laptop and resume. Resume or CV. It was the other combined answer.

**Kevin Ball:** Once again, I'll just go into what would I bring, which is gonna be totally off...

**Jerod Santo:** Rigatoni?

**Kevin Ball:** I'd bring a notebook.

**Jerod Santo:** What did you say?

**Kevin Ball:** A notebook.

**Ali Spittel:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** \[win sound\] That's the number four answer. Notebook, or pen and paper. I combined those.

**Emma Bostian:** You actually said you were gonna bring your pet skunk, or something... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** I thought you were gonna say rigatoni again. \[laughter\] Okay, that's correct...

**Abenezer Abebe:** Rigatoni... \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** We'll go to Ali.

**Kevin Ball:** No, that's the pump-up music I listen to on the way.

**Jerod Santo:** On the way...! Good call. Alright, you've got one more chance here, Ali. You've got two answers left.

**Ali Spittel:** This is so hard. Your own whiteboard? I have no idea. \[fail sound\] \[laughter\] \[unintelligible 00:26:40.03\]

**Kevin Ball:** "Your whiteboard is insufficient. I brought mine!"

**Abenezer Abebe:** It's a very different BYOB.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, really. Okay, so chance to steal, team Emma.

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, guys, I have ideas. I think it's either something intangible, like confidence, or a smile...

**Abenezer Abebe:** I was thinking confidence, too.

**Nick Nisi:** I was thinking something like code examples. Printed out... "I printed out my code."

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, like a coding book, or like... But at the same time, the last time we were pretty certain it was gonna be white noise, and now I'm like "Hm... Maybe it is confidence."

**Abenezer Abebe:** Do frontend developers bring a portfolio? Is that a thing?

**Mikeal Rogers:** That would have been grouped in CV, I think.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

**Emma Bostian:** Should we go confidence, or should we go notes? I think notes might be good, because you wanna do last-minute studying...

**Jerod Santo:** Notebook has been taken. Notebook/pen & paper was taken.

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, okay. That's a good point. So maybe should we just go confidence?

**Nick Nisi:** Sure.

**Abenezer Abebe:** I like it. I'm confident about this one.

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, confidence, for 500, please. \[fail sound\]

**Abenezer Abebe:** Aww...

**Jerod Santo:** Somebody said confidence, but not enough. And this one might get controversial, because I did not group together past projects/portfolio with resume.

**Emma Bostian:** Are you serious?

**Kevin Ball:** I was gonna comment on that, but then held back \[unintelligible 00:28:06.29\]

**Jerod Santo:** Because it's different. It's a different thing. Isn't it?

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, you're right. It is.

**Ali Spittel:** Like, printed out?

**Jerod Santo:** Well, they've just said "I bring my past projects." I think it's your history, it's your experience; it's not necessarily your resume, but in a sense it is your resume.

**Mikeal Rogers:** I bring my GitHub accounts to the interview...

**Ali Spittel:** Yeah, you have your laptop already...

**Emma Bostian:** My SSH key...

**Nick Nisi:** You print it out, "This is where I took comments, this is how I made an if statement..."

**Jerod Santo:** Here's how the breakdown went - 22 people said laptop or computer, and then 16 said portfolio or past projects. And then 13 said resume or CV. 8 said notebook, pen and paper, and then 6 (the number five answer) was a combination of people saying me, myself, my brain... Self-referential statements... Which was like "Of course you're gonna bring yourself."

**Abenezer Abebe:** It's like confidence, but... Not.

**Jerod Santo:** We love our listeners... Well, there were some confidence people. Some people said humor, positivity, confidence... There was like a couple of those. One person said "Your A game." \[laughter\]

**Mikeal Rogers:** Oh, I feel like you got robbed a little on the confidence. I mean, it only would have been one person, but I feel like those would have been grouped together.

**Emma Bostian:** Thank you.

**Jerod Santo:** Maybe.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Somebody said pants, a fancy shirt... Someone did say a Node.js T-shirt.

**Kevin Ball:** I was gonna say, in the age of Zoom interviews, do you really need pants? I can see no one's pants right now.

**Jerod Santo:** And then the two answers that really confused me the most - one person said blockchain... \[laughter\]

**Nick Nisi:** Of course.

**Jerod Santo:** And one person said GraphQL. So... There you go.

**Abenezer Abebe:** They're gonna bring GraphQL. Oh...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Mikeal Rogers:** That is funny, in that the solution to everything is a blockchain.

**Abenezer Abebe:** I love it. I think the audience has humor.

**Emma Bostian:** That's the best part about this game. This game - you can get whatever answers people dream up.

**Break:** \[00:29:57.06\]

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so after the regular rounds -- team Kball wins that round, but there's only a few points. It totals up to 62 points. And team Emma has 106 points. So team Emma wins, and now we move on to our Fast Money round. Emma, the three of you can decide which of the two of you -- or maybe just decide who's gonna sit out and not play Fast Money round.

**Abenezer Abebe:** As the newbie, I can sit back and appreciate my team. Go for it.

**Emma Bostian:** Aww...

**Nick Nisi:** I think as the non-regular you should be on, and I'll sit out.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, you are a guest...

**Emma Bostian:** Oh my God, all of the nice people... I didn't even offer, because I'm ready to go. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Emma wants to play. She's ready.

**Emma Bostian:** I do.

**Nick Nisi:** Go ahead, Abenezer.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Alright.

**Emma Bostian:** Thanks, Nick.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, so Emma and Abenezer? Okay.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Thanks, Nick.

**Emma Bostian:** Abenezer, do you want to go first or second? If you go second, you cannot answer the things I've already answered.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. And you also have to go into a cone of silence.

**Emma Bostian:** And it's fast.

**Jerod Santo:** So here's how this works - one of you will go first. I have five things to name, and you're just trying to get the highest up the count. So you're trying to find the number one answer. You've got ten seconds. So you've gotta just name it, name it, name it. There's five of those. Then when the first person is done, then we bring out the person who's been silenced, and it's their turn. They have to have no knowledge of what the first person guessed, and they go through the same five. Now, they get a little bit longer time, because if you duplicate what the first person says, you get a second guess. And then we add up the total points and see what we score. So would you like to go first or second?

**Abenezer Abebe:** Let me see if I got that. So you basically list out five categories, and we have to just name as many of those things as possible.

**Jerod Santo:** You name one thing per category.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Per category.

**Jerod Santo:** I'll name five categories, you'll name one. So you're trying to find the top one for each, and then we move on.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Alright, cool.

**Jerod Santo:** Who wants to go first?

**Abenezer Abebe:** What do you think, Emma?

**Emma Bostian:** I'm happy to let you go first, because I'm really good at BS-ing my way through things...

**Abenezer Abebe:** Wow. I love it.

**Emma Bostian:** So I can do that. Jerod, in terms of me going into a cone of silence - I can mute this screen and just look at our DM, and you just DM me when you need me to come back.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, very good.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** So turn off your things, mute the things...

**Emma Bostian:** Alright.

**Jerod Santo:** Enter the cone of silence.

**Kevin Ball:** We've gotta say some nasty things about Emma to make sure she's actually muted, right?

**Jerod Santo:** Can you believe that \[unintelligible 00:33:19.27\] \[laughter\] She's laughing, so I don't think she's muted yet.

**Mikeal Rogers:** I don't think someone would cheat to get a non-existent prize.

**Kevin Ball:** You don't know how competitive she is.

**Jerod Santo:** You haven't played with Emma. \[laughter\] She wants to win, man. She wants to win.

**Kevin Ball:** No, I think it's fine.

**Jerod Santo:** Is she actually muted now?

**Mikeal Rogers:** They've already basically won. It's just like the degree of winning.

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Kevin Ball:** I don't know if she's forgiven me for JS Jeopardy yet though, so...

**Jerod Santo:** That's true. Alright, Abenezer, are you ready?

**Abenezer Abebe:** Yes.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Let's play a sound, so it sounds like we're starting a thing. Name a database often used in web development.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Postgres.

**Jerod Santo:** Name a semantic HTML element.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Section.

**Jerod Santo:** Name a JavaScript library that you use often.

**Abenezer Abebe:** React.

**Jerod Santo:** Name something that you associate with Google Chrome.

**Abenezer Abebe:** DevTools.

**Jerod Santo:** Last one - name something people eat while coding.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Nuts.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, very good.

**Mikeal Rogers:** That was really good. I feel like that was a lot of top answers.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, let's go to Emma here. Let me get her back. Okay, I just DM-ed her. Let's see if she notices. There she comes.

**Emma Bostian:** Nice... You look so sad. I'm scared.

**Kevin Ball:** No, he did great.

**Jerod Santo:** No table talk?

**Emma Bostian:** I know you can't tell me anything, so...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, Emma... Same thing that I just did to Abenezer. If you have an answer that's duplicated, you'll hear this sound.

**Emma Bostian:** But I do get an extra five seconds, right?

**Jerod Santo:** That's correct.

**Emma Bostian:** Cool.

**Jerod Santo:** Are you ready?

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Name a database often used in web development.

**Emma Bostian:** MySQL.

**Jerod Santo:** Name a semantic HTML element.

**Emma Bostian:** Div. Dammit, sorry. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Name a JavaScript library that you use often.

**Emma Bostian:** jQuery.

**Jerod Santo:** Name something that you associate with Google Chrome.

**Emma Bostian:** DevTools. \[repeat sound\] Searching things. I don't know...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Name something people eat while coding.

**Emma Bostian:** Chips?

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Emma Bostian:** Oh my god, that was so bad. I'm never playing another game again. I'm going into a cone of shame.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Shout-out to jQuery though.

**Kevin Ball:** I think y'all are winning already.

**Mikeal Rogers:** Those were good, because Abenezer hit all of the top ones.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes.

**Emma Bostian:** Name a semantic element. Div? \[laughter\]

**Abenezer Abebe:** You found the one...

**Jerod Santo:** Well, that was the best moment of this show so far...

**Mikeal Rogers:** But I feel like that's a mistake that a lot of people might make... So there actually might be a lot of those... \[laughter\]

**Kevin Ball:** You did call yourselves the HTML Assassins, right? \[laughter\] You assassinated HTML right there... \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** But what was the first question? I don't remember, because I struggled...

**Mikeal Rogers:** Database.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, let's go through them one by one here.

**Mikeal Rogers:** That was a great answer for database, because he said Postgres and you said MySQL.

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, okay.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right. So name a database often used in web development - Postgres was the number two answer with 21, so you got 21 points there. And then Emma, you said MySQL, which was the number three answer, with 20. So you scored very well on that round. The number one answer, with 44, was MongoDB.

**Emma Bostian:** Mongo...

**Jerod Santo:** Yup. Also making the board - local storage, with seven, SQLite with 4, Firebase with 4, one person said Redis. Okay. Name a semantic HTML element - we had section, that was Abenezer's, and that was the number two answer, with 17.

**Emma Bostian:** Nice!

**Jerod Santo:** Let me see how I'm gonna add these up here.

**Emma Bostian:** Please tell me someone said div.

**Jerod Santo:** And Emma said div, and so did four other people, so you got four points for that.

**Emma Bostian:** Ha-ha!

**Jerod Santo:** Number six answer. The number one answer was article.

**Emma Bostian:** I'm a little surprised by that.

**Mikeal Rogers:** \[unintelligible 00:37:16.00\]

**Emma Bostian:** That's like you're trying to prove how smart you are at HTML.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Article is a deep cut. I don't know how often people use it, but...

**Mikeal Rogers:** You've got a savvy survey crew here...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, we do. We have very smart listeners. Okay, the next one - name a JavaScript library that you use often. We had React, which was the number one answer, 29 points, and we had jQuery, which was the number four answer, with 6 points. So you both did very well there.

**Emma Bostian:** I don't use jQuery, but it was the only thing I remembered...

**Jerod Santo:** Coming in at number two - Lodash, with 17 points. Then Vue with 9, jQuery (like we said) with 6, Moment also with 6, and then some other ones... What's this TypeScript thing? I don't know. Okay, moving on...

Name something that you associate with Google Chrome. Abenezer, you said DevTools - number one answer, DevTools. Very good. 37 people said DevTools. Emma, you said "searching things."

**Emma Bostian:** \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Can I find it on the board somewhere?

**Mikeal Rogers:** Search is not on the board?

**Jerod Santo:** No.

**Kevin Ball:** Did no one say "monopoly", or...?

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so number one answer was DevTools, with 37. Number two was memory use and RAM, with 24. \[laughter\] Number three was tracking and privacy, with 13, and then monopoly was number four, with 5. And then just the word Google... People associate Google with Google Chrome. Five people said that. Three said tabs, three said extensions, two said v8.

**Abenezer Abebe:** \[unintelligible 00:38:45.26\]

**Jerod Santo:** So no points for Emma there.

**Mikeal Rogers:** I may have said updates, or something, for that...

**Abenezer Abebe:** Yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** Name something people eat while coding. Abenezer said nuts; it is on the board, number seven; mixed nuts. Plus four, so you get four points there.

**Emma Bostian:** It's bar food.

**Jerod Santo:** And Emma said chips, number one answer. 28 points.

**Emma Bostian:** Ha-ha! We ain't healthy...! It could be sand chips I guess, but...

**Jerod Santo:** Other answers include Cheetos, pizza, protein bars, cookies, candies, sweets, chocolate... And coffee, which--

**Abenezer Abebe:** People are eating coffee.

**Jerod Santo:** Good answer, but you don't eat coffee...

**Kevin Ball:** You've never brewed it really dark...

**Jerod Santo:** Ramen, Beef Jerky and Soylent.

**Mikeal Rogers:** I feel like there's some kind of \[unintelligible 00:39:34.28\]

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. There were two Soylents though...

**Mikeal Rogers:** These are Charlie answers, for sure...

**Ali Spittel:** Soylents...

**Jerod Santo:** So combined, the two of you scored 166 points. You were trying to get to get to 200; you didn't quite make it, but the numbers were completely arbitrary, because I don't even know how this game really works... Plus, there's no money. So hey, let's just say you guys won!

**Emma Bostian:** Yaay!

**Jerod Santo:** Congratulations!

**Abenezer Abebe:** This is so much fun!

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so that has been Frontend Feud. The HTML Assassins really murdered this one, and managed to pull out a victory. The Diesel Destroyers also were here... And thanks so much everybody for playing; thank you, Emma, thank you Abenezer, thanks Nick, thanks Kball, thank you Ali, and thank you Mikeal. Our special guests, Abenezer and Ali - thanks for hopping on and being part of JS Party. We appreciate it a lot.

**Abenezer Abebe:** Pleasure.

**Jerod Santo:** That's Frontend Feud. If you want us to play this again, let us know. Comment, like and subscribe. Do whatever it is that makes us know that we wanna play again. We do have more questions. We covered about 10 of them, and we asked 25. So there's more available. We can keep playing this game if you'd like to hear it.

**Mikeal Rogers:** We could do one about Node.js, too.

**Kevin Ball:** I've gotta say, y'all are missing out if you're not listening to reggaeton, especially if you've got a standing desk. I'm dancing all day as I'm coding here. \[laughter\]

**Abenezer Abebe:** \[unintelligible 00:41:00.14\]

**Jerod Santo:** So we'll leave you with the visual thought of Kball dancing to reggaetoni... That's JS Party for this week, we'll talk to you next time.

**Outro:** \[00:41:21.20\]

**Jerod Santo:** Alright... I didn't have my normal JS Party \[unintelligible 00:42:20.17\] No, that's JS Danger. There it is... Now it's the chill beats. Everybody can relax...

**Emma Bostian:** On low-fi...

**Jerod Santo:** Yes.

**Mikeal Rogers:** There we go.

**Jerod Santo:** I forgot to read, one of them was -- on where do people code... I wrote down some of the funny answers, but I forgot to read them on the show. Oh yeah, so three people did say the basement. One person said outside, one person said front yard, one person said back alley... \[laughter\]

**Ali Spittel:** Did you do these interviews live, or were they a form, or something like that?

**Jerod Santo:** It was a form, yeah.

**Ali Spittel:** Okay. So then that gives people time to troll, or whatever...

**Jerod Santo:** Totally. And sit there and think.

**Ali Spittel:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** One person said C:\\ I was like, "Well, that's a nerd..." And then the best one - I forgot to read it on the show - Where do people code, "The darkest depths of hell." \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** That's the title of this show.

**Jerod Santo:** I forgot to read it...! But that was fun. Thanks for playing, everyone.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, that was fun! Thank you for putting that together.

**Jerod Santo:** So much fun!
