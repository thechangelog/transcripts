**Jerod Santo:** The sound of those BMC beats means you know what time it is - it is JS Party time, y'all... And we are here to have some fun, and to play a game. We have a special guest - Scott Tolinski is with us here. Hey, Scott. Thanks for joining us.

**Scott Tolinski:** Glad to be here.

**Jerod Santo:** And of course, joined by two regular panelists. I've got Nick Nisi here. What's up, Nick?

**Nick Nisi:** Ahoy-hoy!

**Jerod Santo:** And of course, Emma Bostian is with us. What's up, Emma?

**Emma Bostian:** Hey, everyone. How are you?

**Jerod Santo:** Very good. Emma, last time, you came up with this crazy idea of a JS/Web/Developer trivia game, that's kind of like Jeopardy, but we can't call it jeopardy, so I'm calling it Danger, because... Reasons. And you hosted it last time, but now you're here to compete. What's up!? Are you ready to go?

**Emma Bostian:** I feel like karma is coming back around, but I'm ready.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay... So here's how this is going to work. We have a Jeopardy-esque - but not Jeopardy, due to copyright infringement reasons - board, that we can see, that y'all can see, but we will read aloud all the things... And each person - Nick, Scott, and Emma will take turns picking questions off the board, and trying to get the highest score, just like you would in the game they call Jeopardy.

Our categories for the first round - this is not double-trouble, this is regular trouble, regular danger... We have five categories. The first category is DOM Observer, the second one is CSS Tricks (notice there's no hyphen there, because it's not the website), the third category is Books and Authors, category is Browserified - I've never actually had to say that out loud... Browserified?

**Emma Bostian:** Browserified.

**Jerod Santo:** \[03:52\] Thank you! And the fifth category is Essential Elements. Each of those has five choices, 100 points up to 500 points... And we'll start with our guest, because that's polite and kind. So Scott, you are up first, my friend.

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh, no.

**Jerod Santo:** Please pick a category and pick a point value, and let's see how you do.

**Scott Tolinski:** Okay, let's do Essential Elements for 100.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, starting off easy...

**Scott Tolinski:** Gotta warm up...

**Jerod Santo:** Essential Elements for 100. To, dawg... Xzibit heard you like browsing contexts, so he used this element to put a new browsing context inside your browsing context, so you can browse contexts while you browse contexts.

**Scott Tolinski:** Ding! Do I ding, or do I...?

**Jerod Santo:** So we can't play the exact way, since latency and timers, internet stuff... \[laughter\] So you don't have to ding, because this is your turn. What happens is you get to guess, only you. If you get it wrong, then we will get a chance to steal from Emma and Nick. And if you get it right, then you get the points.

**Scott Tolinski:** Okay. I would guess these are HTML elements I'm guessing, so an iFrame...

**Jerod Santo:** Ta-daa! You are correct, sir.

**Emma Bostian:** I'm gonna be honest, I would have gotten that wrong. Just the exhibit and the dogs just threw me...

**Scott Tolinski:** \[laughs\] It makes it easier for me, that's how I typically...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, you're gonna do well then, because I try to spice up these, somewhat...

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, gosh...

**Jerod Santo:** I mean, it's hard to come up with interesting questions about HTML elements, but we're trying. So Team 1 gets 100 points.

**Emma Bostian:** Nice, nice, nice...

**Jerod Santo:** Congratulations, Scott!

**Emma Bostian:** Don't get too comfortable over there...

**Jerod Santo:** That one's off the board. Emma, you are up, my friend. Pick a category, pick a point value.

**Emma Bostian:** I'm gonna go CSS for 300, please.

**Jerod Santo:** CSS Tricks for 300. This sometimes useful, sometimes annoying algorithm at the core of CSS defines how to combine property values originating from different sources.

**Emma Bostian:** Are these combinators?

**Jerod Santo:** I think you're thinking a little too hard...

**Emma Bostian:** Specificity!

**Jerod Santo:** Well, chance to steal...

**Emma Bostian:** No...!

**Jerod Santo:** Nick, would you like to steal?

**Nick Nisi:** Yes.

**Jerod Santo:** Your answer is...?

**Nick Nisi:** What is the cascade?

**Jerod Santo:** What is the cascade!

**Emma Bostian:** Hey, I thought I was good at CSS...

**Jerod Santo:** So Nick gets the ta-da! And I forgot to play the fail sound, because I'm a failure of an Alex Trebek... Team 2 is Emma, you go down 300 and Nick goes up 300.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay, I'm gonna challenge -- I don't think the cascade is an algorithm, okay? I disagree with that.

**Jerod Santo:** This exact phraseology was pulled off of the Mozilla Developer Networks website, in which they call it that.

**Emma Bostian:** I've got a problem with them. I disagree.

**Jerod Santo:** So you can take that up with the fine folks at Mozilla...

**Scott Tolinski:** \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** ...and check with the experts. Okay.

**Emma Bostian:** Whatever...

**Jerod Santo:** So Emma off to a slow start. She is playing her best version of Chris Hiller from last time.

**Emma Bostian:** \[laughs\] Whatever.

**Jerod Santo:** Now it is Nick's turn.

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, no.

**Jerod Santo:** Nick, please select a category and a point value.

**Nick Nisi:** Okay, I'm gonna be safe and I'm gonna go with Browserified for 100, please, just because I wanna know what this category is.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. So as of March 2020, this browser commended 4.42% of global market share.

**Nick Nisi:** What is Firefox?

**Jerod Santo:** What is Firefox!

**Nick Nisi:** Alright!

**Scott Tolinski:** Wow, that's less than I thought. Wow.

**Emma Bostian:** I am gonna get all of these wrong...

**Jerod Santo:** Nice job!

**Scott Tolinski:** That's less...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, that is less than you would think.

**Nick Nisi:** It is, unfortunately.

**Jerod Santo:** That includes mobile though, of which they have no -- they have nothing on mobile, so...

**Emma Bostian:** What makes up the other 96%?

**Scott Tolinski:** Chrome.

**Jerod Santo:** Chrome.

**Emma Bostian:** \[laughs\] That's shocking, honestly.

**Scott Tolinski:** It is, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so after one round of play, Scott has 100 points, Emma has -300, and Nick is sitting in first place with 400. We're going now to round two. Scott, your turn. Please choose a category and a point value.

**Scott Tolinski:** Let's do Essential Elements for 300.

**Jerod Santo:** Essential Elements for 300. This penultimate header element in descending importance.

**Scott Tolinski:** I don't know what penultimate means. Penultimate... Is it-- penultimate.

**Emma Bostian:** No questions allowed, sir. You can't ask questions... \[laughter\]

**Scott Tolinski:** \[08:06\] I'm not asking questions here...

**Jerod Santo:** He's talking to himself.

**Scott Tolinski:** I'm talking to myself here, yeah... Okay, penultimate, I have to figure out what that means first.

**Jerod Santo:** Running out of time...

**Scott Tolinski:** H5?

**Jerod Santo:** Wow...!

**Scott Tolinski:** Second to last?

**Jerod Santo:** Second to last. Yes, penultimate means second to last, and it's in descending importance. So there's H1 through H6, and that puts H5 as the second to last, the penultimate. Very good answer.

**Emma Bostian:** I don't like that you're trying to confuse us with your jargon. Like, we're all layman people, okay?

**Jerod Santo:** Have you ever watched the show Trouble?

**Emma Bostian:** I'm losing my English from living abroad. This is unfair.

**Jerod Santo:** This is JS Danger Party here. Things are getting dangerous. Emma, your turn. There's some dangerous language at play.

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, I'm also going to just bring up the fact that Rebecca in the chat says "Technically, he doesn't have to answer as a question", so technically, we should be answering these as questions...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, shoot... That is correct. I will do better, Rebecca. That was never explained to me.

**Emma Bostian:** So I think everyone should go back to zero, but anyway... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Starting now... Starting now we're gonna enforce--

**Emma Bostian:** Let's maybe do Books and Authors for 100...

**Jerod Santo:** Books and Authors, okay... Here we go. YDKJS, the popular series of books diving deep into the core mechanics of JavaScript is authored by this JS Party guest.

**Emma Bostian:** Who is Kyle Simpson.

**Jerod Santo:** Who is Kyle Simpson, indeed! Good job, Emma.

**Emma Bostian:** I've read all his books.

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah, they're good.

**Jerod Santo:** Team 2, you're digging your way out of --

**Emma Bostian:** I read lots of books, so maybe this is my category.

**Jerod Santo:** That might be your category. You might want to come back to the well. Okay, Nick's turn to select a category.

**Nick Nisi:** Alright... I'm gonna do DOM Observer for 200, please.

**Jerod Santo:** DOM Observer for 200... This is the state of a failed promise. It better have a good reason...

**Nick Nisi:** What is reject.

**Jerod Santo:** What is rejected. I will take it. A pending promise can either be fulfilled with a value, or rejected with a reason. Good job, Nick.

**Emma Bostian:** That's the answer to "What is the status of my job application?" \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Nick, with 600. And we go back to Scott. Top of the board!

**Scott Tolinski:** Heating up! Let's do Essential Elements for 400.

**Jerod Santo:** You like your HTML, don't you?

**Emma Bostian:** You're riding the wave...

**Scott Tolinski:** Living in it, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** According to a random \[unintelligible 00:10:24.04\] with zero due diligence performed, the shortest valid HTML document includes a doc type, and this one other element.

**Scott Tolinski:** One additional element...

**Jerod Santo:** We're gonna need an answer.

**Scott Tolinski:** I know... Let's go ahead and just say HTML.

**Emma Bostian:** You didn't answer as a question, Scott.

**Scott Tolinski:** What is HTML?

**Jerod Santo:** Incorrect.

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, crap...

**Jerod Santo:** Now we go to Emma for the steal... You can pass. You do not have to steal it. We'll go to Nick for a steal.

**Emma Bostian:** Do I lose points if I get it wrong though, because it's a steal?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes.

**Emma Bostian:** Oh... I don't think I'm in a place to do this. I'm gonna pass.

**Jerod Santo:** This game wouldn't be called Danger if you didn't lose points, stealing...

**Emma Bostian:** I'm gonna pass, because that would have been my guess.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Nick, would you like to steal?

**Nick Nisi:** Yes. What is a title?

**Emma Bostian:** Oh...!!!

**Scott Tolinski:** It needs a title? What?! I didn't know that...

**Nick Nisi:** I saw the same random gist.

**Jerod Santo:** Did you see that?

**Nick Nisi:** Yes!

**Jerod Santo:** So all you need is doc type HTML...

**Emma Bostian:** He wrote that random gist! He wrote that just for you, Jerod. \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** ...and then title, and this will pass W3C validator, with just a very small amount of HTML.

**Scott Tolinski:** Crazy...

**Emma Bostian:** I'm surprised it's not an HTML tag, but whatever...

**Scott Tolinski:** Me too.

**Jerod Santo:** So - steals... Team 3. Holy cow. Nick, you have 1,000 points.

**Emma Bostian:** I'm catching up to you, Scott. You wait.

**Scott Tolinski:** Ah...!

**Jerod Santo:** Okay... That was Scott's turn, so now we go to Emma for your turn.

**Emma Bostian:** Let's choose CSS Tricks for 200, please.

**Jerod Santo:** CSS Tricks for 200. Floated objects do not add to the height of the object they reside in properly. To fix it, one must... How do you fix them?

**Emma Bostian:** \[12:10\] Um... What is clear fix?

**Jerod Santo:** Clear the floats. Congratulations.

**Emma Bostian:** Yaay! I don't know how to use clear fix, because I use Flexbox, but it's fine.

**Jerod Santo:** This is an ancient question, from an ancient day.

**Emma Bostian:** Guess what, Scott. We tied!

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh...!

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so Scott was zero...

**Emma Bostian:** Did I tell you I trash-talk, by the way? \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Emma with zero... Nick, in a commanding lead with 1,000...

**Scott Tolinski:** I appreciate the competition.

**Jerod Santo:** And Nick, it is now your turn. You're both the lead and the board, sir.

**Nick Nisi:** Alright... Let's go with Essential Elements for 200, please.

**Jerod Santo:** Essential Elements for 200. This element was once all the rage, because you could put it inside a map element, and add links to different parts of an image.

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, man...!

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah, what was this called?

**Emma Bostian:** Get it wrong, get it wrong...! \[laughter\]

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, man... I lose points either way, right?

**Jerod Santo:** Correct.

**Nick Nisi:** What is an anchor tag?

**Jerod Santo:** Anchor tag... Incorrect. Scott for the steal?

**Scott Tolinski:** Because you could put it inside a map element and links to different parts of an image... I don't know what this is called, I'm gonna pass.

**Jerod Santo:** He's gonna pass.

**Scott Tolinski:** I know what it is.

**Emma Bostian:** I'm also passing. I'm totally passing.

**Jerod Santo:** Used to be all the rage. Everyone's passing.

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah, image maps...

**Emma Bostian:** I ain't got no points for this...

**Jerod Santo:** So apparently the hardest one... What is area?

**Emma Bostian:** Oh...

**Scott Tolinski:** I haven't seen this be used since the SpaceJam site.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, exactly. You would put coordinates of some kind, and then you'd also put an href. So there's your anchor, Nick. It would be on the area. And that anchor would be clickable in the coordinates given. This was definitely an old school thing...

**Scott Tolinski:** Sorry, I've got dogs barking.

**Jerod Santo:** It's all good.

**Emma Bostian:** It's okay... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** That's why we call it Danger Game. \[laughter\] I don't even know how that applies... Okay. Whose turn was that?

**Nick Nisi:** That was mine.

**Emma Bostian:** That was Nick's.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so we go back to Scott, top of the board here...

**Scott Tolinski:** Alright...

**Nick Nisi:** I think I need to lose 200 points.

**Scott Tolinski:** I need to gain some points here. Let's do CSS Tricks for 100. Play it safe, hopefully.

**Emma Bostian:** That's what you think.

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah, right.

**Jerod Santo:** Frontenders once employed multiple background images and nested divs to achieve the rounding effect possible with this one property.

**Scott Tolinski:** What is border-radius?

**Jerod Santo:** Correct, sir. What is border-radius. Good job, you get 100 points. Okay. Next up, Emma.

**Emma Bostian:** We'll do CSS for 400, please.

**Jerod Santo:** Location, location, location. There's no better place for your style rule to ensure it gets applied.

**Emma Bostian:** What is in-line styling?

**Jerod Santo:** What is in-line styling. Correct!

**Emma Bostian:** Specificity paid off!

**Jerod Santo:** You get 400 points.

**Emma Bostian:** Thank you!

**Jerod Santo:** We're now back to Team 3. That's you, Nick.

**Nick Nisi:** Alright, let's do DOM Observer for 300, please.

**Jerod Santo:** Where am I? Look through the window, and figure out this useful piece of information.

**Nick Nisi:** What is location?

**Jerod Santo:** What is location indeed. Very good. \[unintelligible 00:15:19.21\] location is a read-only location object. You can also assign a DOMstring to it. Good job, Nick. You get 300 points.

**Nick Nisi:** Only give me 100.

**Jerod Santo:** After multiple rounds that I'm not counting, we have Scott at 100...

**Scott Tolinski:** I think Emma just got some free points.

**Jerod Santo:** Did she? Did I just give them to the wrong person?

**Emma Bostian:** Oh...! I didn't even notice. I was like "Wow, I'm doing so well..." \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Hold on... I'm not actually sure how to go back now. Who was that? That was... Yeah, I'll just subtract off of hers, and add to Nick's. Okay, that works.

**Nick Nisi:** I should be at 1,100.

**Jerod Santo:** I don't know how to do that. You have 1,300, sir. \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** Welcome to JS Danger, where the points are made up, and the points don't matter. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** That's right. This is no safe game over here. We don't know what's gonna happen. So Emma has 400, and Nick has 1,300, although it could be technically 1,100, but we're not gonna nitpick.

**Emma Bostian:** He's way above, it doesn't matter anyway.

**Jerod Santo:** \[16:12\] Okay, back to Scott... Please pick a category and a point value.

**Scott Tolinski:** Let's do Essential Elements for $500, please.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, here it is. Want to bump up the size of some text? This now obsolete element once used to do the trick.

**Scott Tolinski:** Um...

**Jerod Santo:** Full disclosure, I did not know this was a thing until I found this...

**Scott Tolinski:** Shoot, I actually know what this is. What is large? No...

**Jerod Santo:** For the steal. Emma, you've got a shot at it.

**Emma Bostian:** I'm not even gonna remotely try.

**Jerod Santo:** Nick, would you like to steal?

**Nick Nisi:** Nope.

**Jerod Santo:** I will say this, Scott - you were dangerously close. What is big?

**Scott Tolinski:** Yes, \[unintelligible 00:16:59.00\] something stupid.

**Jerod Santo:** It is stupid.

**Emma Bostian:** \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** So this was used a lot like the strong tag, or the em, where you put around some text... And it would actually just take the current text you have it wrapped around and make it one font size larger than the surrounding text, completely non-semantically. So there you go... So that goes down, Scott, now at -400 after that huge, huge failure.

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh...!

**Jerod Santo:** And we are back to Emma.

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, gosh... Alright, I'm gonna try CSS Tricks for 500, please.

**Jerod Santo:** I thought you liked Books and Authors. You got it once and you just completely--

**Emma Bostian:** I do, but now I'm scared, because I feel like that was the only programming book I knew the author for.

**Jerod Santo:** With Flexbox you can center an element on the page...

**Emma Bostian:** Ha-ha-haaa! Sorry.

**Jerod Santo:** ...by setting these two properties to center.

**Scott Tolinski:** What is justify-content and align-items?

**Jerod Santo:** Very good! She knows her Flexbox, people. Okay, that's 500 points. That's a big win. Your turn, Nick. She's catching up on you.

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, no... Okay, I'll do DOM Observer for 400.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Spawn a web worker to keep your interface snappy, and communicate with it by calling this method.

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, no...! I can't think of the exact method, but I know it... Ah, I don't know it.

**Jerod Santo:** Scott for the steal.

**Scott Tolinski:** Keep your interface snappy, and communicate with it... What is request animation frame? No.

**Jerod Santo:** Emma, would you like to steal?

**Emma Bostian:** I am passing this so hard.

**Jerod Santo:** Emma passes. So Scott goes down, and Nick goes down 400 points. The correct answer is post message.

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, there it is. Yes!

**Scott Tolinski:** I don't work with workers.

**Jerod Santo:** Worker.post message sends a message, you send it a JavaScript object, and you pass data back and forth that way. Okay, well - it's tightening up, except for our special guest, who seems to be falling by the wayside, but... It's still early.

**Emma Bostian:** Well, he's almost at 900, just negative.

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah, we're absolute-valuing these values, right?

**Emma Bostian:** Sure, sure.

**Scott Tolinski:** Let's do Books and Authors for 300.

**Jerod Santo:** You got it. This co-authored book's sales pitch says "Learn how to design beautiful user interfaces by yourself, using specific tactics explained from a developer's point of view."

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh, god...

**Emma Bostian:** I know it. I totally know it.

**Jerod Santo:** This is just straight up their marketing copy, right off their homepage.

**Scott Tolinski:** I have no idea. I don't read books, so... This is a bad topic for me.

**Jerod Santo:** You shouldn't have picked this topic.

**Scott Tolinski:** I shouldn't have picked this topic.

**Jerod Santo:** That was dangerous.

**Scott Tolinski:** I thought I was gonna get lucky, but... Co-authored book's sales pitch...

**Emma Bostian:** I totally know this, I think.

**Scott Tolinski:** It's co-authored... So I'm supposed to be answering the book itself, or the author?

**Jerod Santo:** The book.

**Scott Tolinski:** The book.

**Jerod Santo:** Co-authored is just a hint that it's written by more than one person, but the book title is what you're after.

**Scott Tolinski:** Gotcha. Learn how to design beautiful user interfaces by yourself, using specific tactics explained from a developer's point of view...

**Emma Bostian:** You're stalling...

**Scott Tolinski:** I am stalling, because I don't know the answer.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, this is one of those you know it or you don'ts.

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah, I don't know the answer to this... What is Modern Web Design.

**Emma Bostian:** \[20:09\] \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Incorrect, sir. Emma for the steal.

**Emma Bostian:** What is refactoring UI?

**Jerod Santo:** What is refactoring UI. Correct!

**Emma Bostian:** I love this book!

**Jerod Santo:** And with that, Emma steals her way into first place.

**Emma Bostian:** I think it was co-authored by the guys who made -- what's that called... Not \[unintelligible 00:20:28.23\]

**Nick Nisi:** Tailwind.

**Emma Bostian:** Tailwind, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, Adam Wathan and somebody else, that I--

**Scott Tolinski:** Steve Schoger.

**Emma Bostian:** Steve Schoger, Steve Schoger!

**Jerod Santo:** That's correct. Okay, that was Scott's picks. Now we go to Emma.

**Emma Bostian:** Let's do books and authors for 200, please.

**Jerod Santo:** Right in your wheelhouse. Not just for web devs, the authors of this famous programming book were also co-signers of the Agile Manifesto.

**Emma Bostian:** I have no idea, I'll just pass.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, I'll have to make you a fail sound. Okay. And Nick for the steal...

**Nick Nisi:** I lose points either way, right?

**Jerod Santo:** No, you only lose points if you fail to steal. You can pass.

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Emma loses points either way, because it was her question.

**Nick Nisi:** Okay. You know what, I'm just gonna guess. I'll say "What is the Pragmatic Programmer"?

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah, totally.

**Emma Bostian:** Shoot, I thought I was looking for the authors...

**Jerod Santo:** The Pragmatic Programmer, by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas. These two fellas also co-signed The Agile Manifesto back in the day. There you go. Okay... So that knocks Emma down to size. Nick, it's your turn.

**Nick Nisi:** Alright. I'll do Browserified for 300, please.

**Jerod Santo:** With 38% of global web market share, this operating system is number one.

**Nick Nisi:** I feel like this is a trick. Okay... What is Android?

**Jerod Santo:** That is correct! Windows, at 35%. Close second in iOS, at 14%.

**Emma Bostian:** I would have guessed Windows, but it makes more sense, because mobile...

**Nick Nisi:** I was smelling a trick question there.

**Jerod Santo:** Did you answer it as if it was a trick, like Android is the trick answer?

**Nick Nisi:** Yeah, because nobody thinks of Android. I mean, I don't think of Android, so...

**Jerod Santo:** You sniffed it out. And you get however many points that was... 300 points. Good job. Okay, Scott, you're up.

**Scott Tolinski:** Alright, I'm gonna need some big points here, or big -- yeah, let's go 500 and let's do Books and Authors.

**Jerod Santo:** Books and Authors for 500. This tome has been stacked underneath Crockford's Good Parts to poke fun at both books' subject.

**Scott Tolinski:** So this tome has been stacked underneath -- I know the book; it's an O'Reilly book. I don't know that exact title... Shoot.

**Jerod Santo:** I will say you're on the right path. It is indeed an O'Reilly book.

**Scott Tolinski:** Dang. I don't know what it's called. What is the Complete Guide to JavaScript

**Jerod Santo:** I'm gonna have to call that a fail.

**Scott Tolinski:** Dang. I knew it was something like that.

**Jerod Santo:** Pretty close. Do we have Emma care to steal?

**Emma Bostian:** I don't. I'm gonna -- no.

**Jerod Santo:** Nick - for the steal?

**Nick Nisi:** I'm gonna say "What is JavaScript Complete Reference?" \[fail sound\] Oh, no...!

**Jerod Santo:** Ouch! Nick, you were so excited with that answer. The answer is "What is JavaScript: The Definitive Guide"?

**Emma Bostian:** Oh...!

**Jerod Santo:** Your enthusiasm... I assumed you had it. That brings you down to 700. So after these rounds, we have Scott at -600, we have Emma at 1,000 in first place, and Nick barely holding on to second with 700. Well, I guess you're way ahead of Scott, but just holding on to your point total.

**Emma Bostian:** \[laughs\] Oh, gosh...

**Jerod Santo:** Let's be nice to our guests here, folks. Come on. Let's let him get some points here.

**Scott Tolinski:** \[laughs\[

**Jerod Santo:** And whose turn is it now? It is now Emma's turn.

**Emma Bostian:** It's mine... I'm gonna do the last Books and Authors, please.

**Jerod Santo:** \[24:09\] Okay. Whether it's High-performance JavaScript or Understanding ECMAScript 6 that you want to learn, grab a book by this prolific human who codes. So now we're looking for the actual name of the author of these books.

**Emma Bostian:** I feel like I know it, but I'm not 100% sure. But I lose either way, so...

**Jerod Santo:** Correct. So please lob a guess.

**Emma Bostian:** Do I have to guess his whole name?

**Jerod Santo:** As long as I know that you know who it is, I'll count it.

**Emma Bostian:** The only person I can think of right now is that guy Axel R. Something... But that's my only guess. \[fail sound\] Yeah, I don't know.

**Jerod Santo:** I can't count that, so you're gonna lose points on this...

**Emma Bostian:** I know...

**Jerod Santo:** Down 400. Nick, for a steal?

**Nick Nisi:** I've got it down to two people.

**Jerod Santo:** Do you wanna live dangerously?

**Nick Nisi:** Yeah, I wanna live dangerously. I'm gonna go with "Who is Nick Zakas?" \[correct sound\]

**Emma Bostian:** That's the one I was thinking! He's the one with the black and white profile photo, right? Doesn't he, black and white photo? No, he doesn't. But I know who you're talking about.

**Jerod Santo:** He's the creator of ESLint, and I think he goes by @slicknet on social media.

**Emma Bostian:** That's the guy I meant to talk about.

**Jerod Santo:** So Nick steals some points, and steals the lead with that move... And it's also his turn.

**Nick Nisi:** Alright. Let's go with Browserified for 400, please.

**Jerod Santo:** This site-specific browser application for macOS was built on WebKit 2 and featured on many blogs for its ability to make web apps more like native apps...

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, man...

**Jerod Santo:** ...during the height of the SSB craze.

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, I think I know what this is.

**Nick Nisi:** Yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** You probably ran this app, Nick...

**Nick Nisi:** I did. I'm gonna say "What is WebKit JS?" I know that's not right.

**Jerod Santo:** Wrong, and terrible guess. \[laughter\]

**Scott Tolinski:** I'm passing, I have no idea on this.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, I'm passing, too. I ain't doing it.

**Jerod Santo:** Scott will pass, Emma will pass. The correct answer was Fluid.

**Scott Tolinski:** I've never heard of it.

**Jerod Santo:** Fluid.app by Todd Ditchendorf. Again, a little bit older...

**Emma Bostian:** Ditchendorf, that's a cool last name.

**Jerod Santo:** ...back when single-site browsers were very popular. Probably in the 2012(ish) range. Okay. We now go to Scott. You have Browserified for 200 or 500, and you have DOM Observer for 100 and 500.

**Scott Tolinski:** Let's do Browserified for 500.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. This discontinued web browser specialized in providing Web 2.0 facilities and social networking integrations with MySpace, Facebook and YouTube. Download.com rated it 5 out of 5 stars.

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah... I know the title of this, and once again, I only have a little bit of it. Because I know somebody who used to work there. What is -- gosh, I don't know.

**Jerod Santo:** What is your answer?

**Scott Tolinski:** What is Rockforge? \[fail sound\]

**Emma Bostian:** What is your answer... \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, Emma, chance to steal.

**Emma Bostian:** Nope, no way.

**Jerod Santo:** Nick, interested in stealing?

**Nick Nisi:** Hm... No.

**Emma Bostian:** \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** The correct answer - this discontinued web browser is called Flock.

**Scott Tolinski:** I was thinking of Rock Melt. That's the one that I had in my brain.

**Jerod Santo:** Hm. Maybe of the same ilk. There was a time when everybody thought they were gonna launch new browsers as startups...

**Emma Bostian:** Isn't that a rapper though?

**Scott Tolinski:** Rock Melt, the discontinued proprietary social media browser.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. So that's a pretty good guess, too.

**Scott Tolinski:** 2014.

**Jerod Santo:** Unfortunately, you have to go down another 500 points...

**Scott Tolinski:** Bring it on!

**Emma Bostian:** I'm so glad he took that one, because...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] And we're back to Emma. There's now three options on the board, in round one.

**Emma Bostian:** I'm gonna get all of them wrong, so let's go DOM Observer for 100.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. This commonly used mixin contains methods and properties for objects that can have a parent.

**Emma Bostian:** \[28:02\] Commonly used mixin, contains methods and properties for objects that can have a parent... I don't know.

**Jerod Santo:** Is that your final answer?

**Emma Bostian:** No! Objects that can a parent -- I don't know, does this have anything to do with inheritance?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes...

**Emma Bostian:** What's that called. I don't know. It has own property... I don't remember. I don't know.

**Jerod Santo:** \[fail sound\] That wasn't in the form of a question, and also was wrong.

**Emma Bostian:** That's fine, because I went out in flames. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** So I'm gonna knock you down by only 100. And then we have options to steal, first for Nick and then for Scott. Nick, do you wanna steal?

**Nick Nisi:** Yes, I think... The way it's worded is really weird, but...

**Jerod Santo:** This may or may not be copy-pasted off of W3Schools... \[laughter\]

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, man... The mixin part is the weird part.

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah, the mixin part trips me up.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah...

**Nick Nisi:** I'm just gonna say "What is the prototype?" \[fail sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** Incorrect, sir.

**Scott Tolinski:** That's what I would have said too, so I'm gonna pass this, because I don't know.

**Jerod Santo:** I think mixin is probably the word that's screwing us everybody.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, mixin was a terrible word to use for that, Jerod.

**Jerod Santo:** The correct answer is "What is a child node?" A child node is implemented by element, document type, character data objects... Pretty much lots of things. And it's anything that has a parent.

**Emma Bostian:** So I think the lesson learn is don't use W3Schools to learn development.

**Scott Tolinski:** Or anything.

**Nick Nisi:** But also, this was the DOM Observer category, and I was thinking JavaScript... Ugh.

**Emma Bostian:** Ugh, that's how I--

**Jerod Santo:** \[unintelligible 00:29:36.13\]

**Emma Bostian:** Wow, Scott, I am really impressed with your score.

**Scott Tolinski:** Thank you. I'm very impressed with myself, so...

**Jerod Santo:** Maybe we didn't explain that higher scores are better. This is not golf, so... \[laughter\]

**Scott Tolinski:** Okay, okay, okay... I did okay in the first two questions. I got two questions right.

**Jerod Santo:** Hey, there's a lot of game left. We still have Double-Jeopardy waiting for us.

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh, yes!

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, heck yeah!

**Jerod Santo:** So Nick, your turn. We have two more elements in round one. Go ahead and pick Browserified for 200 or DOM Observer for 500.

**Nick Nisi:** A chance to gain the lead and not completely blow it away - I'm gonna say Browserified for 200.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Boasting features such as built-in ad-blocking and VPN, this browser began as a research project in 1994.

**Nick Nisi:** In 1994... I'm gonna say "What is Netscape?" \[fail sound\] Ugh... I knew it.

**Jerod Santo:** Scott for the steal?

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, I know what it is now...

**Scott Tolinski:** It began as a research project in 1994. I wonder when it was released though.

**Jerod Santo:** Correct.

**Scott Tolinski:** What is Brave? \[fail sound\] Yeah... Well, then it came out of Mozilla... So I don't know. Whatever.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, cool, I guess you can name these teams and put your names on them, so I'm not guessing who's who.

**Emma Bostian:** Alright, I'm gonna pass...

**Jerod Santo:** Sorry, I've just noticed something... Emma's gonna pass... Okay, I think the 1994 threw everybody for a loop. Nick, do you know what it is now?

**Nick Nisi:** I do. Is it Opera?

**Jerod Santo:** \[correct sound\] What is Opera... It was actually interesting -- the reason why I thought it was a good question is because it does sound a lot like Brave, until you see it started in 1994... Which kind of throws you for a loop.

**Scott Tolinski:** I know, I was just thinking it was a research project, and it wasn't released then... Whatever.

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Scott Tolinski:** Alright, alright, let's pile it on here.

**Jerod Santo:** Last one of the round - this one goes to Scott; we've got DOM Observer for 500. Are you ready?

**Scott Tolinski:** You bet! I am so ready for this. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** This powerful Web API put the X in Ajax and helped usher in Web 2.0 with living documents.

**Scott Tolinski:** Put the X in Ajax...

**Jerod Santo:** Yes.

**Scott Tolinski:** Asynchronous JavaScript... Put the X and helped -- is it XML? What is XML?

**Jerod Santo:** \[fail sound\] Sorry, you're close, but no cigar. Emma, for the steal.

**Emma Bostian:** Well, that was gonna be my guess, but I don't know if he marked him wrong because he didn't ask as a question, or because it was wrong, so I'm just gonna pass.

**Jerod Santo:** No, it's wrong.

**Emma Bostian:** Okay, then yeah - I'll just pass anyway.

**Jerod Santo:** It's related, but wrong.

**Scott Tolinski:** \[31:59\] Yeah, I know what it is now.

**Jerod Santo:** Nick, would you like to steal?

**Nick Nisi:** Yes. What is XHTML?

**Emma Bostian:** Oh...

**Jerod Santo:** \[fail sound\]

**Scott Tolinski:** What?! I thought it's XHTML. Uh-oh...

**Jerod Santo:** This powerful Web API... Is XHTML a Web API?

**Scott Tolinski:** Well, I don't know. The wording here is always--

**Jerod Santo:** What's the API that \[unintelligible 00:32:16.18\] Come on, y'all...

**Emma Bostian:** A-ha, blame it on the learning.

**Jerod Santo:** XML HTTP Request...

**Nick Nisi:** XML HTTP Request...

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh...!

**Jerod Santo:** ...is the underlying API that makes all Ajax requests possible, even though pretty much nobody sends XML over it anymore... Or even back then. JSON and HTML.

**Emma Bostian:** I just wanted to say a quick note to you both... That passing is a cool thing to do if you don't know the answer... \[laughter\] Just saying...

**Nick Nisi:** I was very confident.

**Scott Tolinski:** I haven't had that many -- I've lost most of my points on my own questions, so...

**Jerod Santo:** This brings us to the end of round one, where we have Scott with -2,800, Nick in second place with -100, and Emma in first, with 500 points.

**Emma Bostian:** \[laughs\]

**Scott Tolinski:** Dang...

**Jerod Santo:** We'll see you in round two.

**Break:** \[33:14\]

**Jerod Santo:** We are back for round two. Some people call it Double Trouble, or Double Danger, or Double Down. I don't know, you pick your favorite. Our categories for this round are "Can I use?", Frameswork, Npm-Install, Bang Important, and "What a Character". Emma, you are first up. Please choose a category and a point value.

**Emma Bostian:** I'll take Important for 300, please.

**Jerod Santo:** If you want extra non-displayed content inside an element to be replaced with a "...", set this property to ellipsis.

**Emma Bostian:** I know this.

**Jerod Santo:** That's what everybody says.

**Emma Bostian:** I used this literally two days ago. What is text-overflow?

**Jerod Santo:** Very good. Text-overflow. Nick, this is your turn.

**Nick Nisi:** Alright!

**Jerod Santo:** Please choose a value.

**Nick Nisi:** I'll go with Npm-Install for 300.

**Jerod Santo:** Easily run command line scripts and other binaries installed from Npm with this related command.

**Nick Nisi:** What is Npx?

**Jerod Santo:** That is correct.

**Emma Bostian:** Nice.

**Jerod Santo:** We're off to a hot start in round two...

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh, just wait... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Scott, it's your turn to keep the ball rolling.

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah, let's -- oh, dear God... Let's do -- I'm gonna get some points here, I promise. Let's do "Can I Use" for 100.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Emma Bostian:** "I'm gonna get some points", goes for 100. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** The number one most searched feature on caniuse.com as of April 9th, 2020 - yes, that is the day - is...

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh, come on...! This is a 100-point question? This is hard! The number one most searched feature on caniuse.com... What is CSS Grid?

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, shoot, I showed you the answer. \[fail sound\]

**Emma Bostian:** I was gonna guess that! Dang it, Jerod!

**Jerod Santo:** Ohhh...! Jerod fail. Okay.

**Scott Tolinski:** Flexbox? Really? Everybody can use Flexbox. It's 2020, people.

**Jerod Santo:** But they're all wondering about it. So the correct answer is Flexbox...

**Scott Tolinski:** \[36:15\] Stop wondering about it.

**Jerod Santo:** ...but it's because it's based on what people wanna know, I guess.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah...

**Scott Tolinski:** They wanna know Grid. Grid is better.

**Emma Bostian:** Well, they're different.

**Jerod Santo:** So no steals, because I screwed it up and showed the answer... But we will just act like I didn't and move on to Emma.

**Emma Bostian:** That's a little unfair, but I guess I'll let you have it.

**Jerod Santo:** I don't know what else to do, honestly...

**Emma Bostian:** Can I do Bang Important for 400, please?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, you may... This HTML entity code is handy for hacky pixel-pushing content around with invisible spacing. Don't do this at home... Or do, depending on how hacky you are.

**Emma Bostian:** HTML entity code? Is handy -- what the hell does that mean?

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh, no...

**Jerod Santo:** Nick just realized what it is.

**Emma Bostian:** HTML entity code... Oh, what is BR? \[fail sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** It's a good guess. And we go to Nick for the steal?

**Nick Nisi:** What is \[37:05\] NBSP?

**Jerod Santo:** \[correct sound\] That is correct.

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah... Non-breaking space-something...

**Jerod Santo:** Non-breaking white space, \[unintelligible 00:37:14.23\] NBSP.

**Emma Bostian:** NSFW, not safe for...

**Jerod Santo:** It will force a white space, and you can just have a whole bunch of those, and force a bunch of white spaces...

**Emma Bostian:** That was gonna be my other guess...

**Jerod Santo:** ...and push things around, to your heart's desire. And I know this one by experience, not just by looking it up. Okay.

**Nick Nisi:** Me too.

**Scott Tolinski:** I know... This is like back in the days of Dreamweaver. It would just add a thousand of them for you.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes. Many tools used to generate those, and now they're just used when something's slightly off and you're like "You know what, we just want one more space in there." Okay. We go to Nick.

**Nick Nisi:** Okay... You know what I'll do - I'll do Npm-Install for 400, please.

**Jerod Santo:** Npm famously doesn't wanna be known as the Node package manager, leading to this running joke on the company's website.

**Nick Nisi:** What...? \[laughter\] What is Nice People Matter? \[fail sound\] I don't know...

**Emma Bostian:** What?!

**Jerod Santo:** Npm famously doesn't want to be known as the Node package manager, leading to this running joke on the company's website. We'll go to Scott for a steal.

**Scott Tolinski:** Um, pass...

**Jerod Santo:** Emma, would you like to steal?

**Emma Bostian:** I would not like to steal.

**Jerod Santo:** So this one was - full disclosure - the last one I did, and kind of lame... The running joke is different acronyms each time you load the page.

**Nick Nisi:** Well, I named a different acronym.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, but that wouldn't be a running joke, that would be a one-time joke. Nice People Matter. \[laughter\] Yes, so every time you reload Npmjs.com, or whatever the website is, it will have a new acronym, because they don't wanna be associated with Node Package Manager. So I'm just gonna apologize for that question and we're gonna move on to Scott.

**Scott Tolinski:** Yes! Let's get some points. Let's do Npm-Install for 200.

**Jerod Santo:** Npm-Install for 200. This Npm subcommand introduced in 2018 helps you identify and fix insecure dependencies.

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh, dang. I don't know. Dependabot is always telling me about them. \[laughter\] Let's see... Sorry, people... What is Npm insecure? \[fail sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** Emma, with an opportunity to steal...

**Emma Bostian:** What is Npm audit fix? \[correct sound\] I know that because all my packages are insecure... \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** What is Npm audit--

**Scott Tolinski:** I update too frequently. I've got updates running every day. I have an update right now.

**Emma Bostian:** I haven't updated since 2011.

**Scott Tolinski:** Dang.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, Emma, it is now your turn to update your score by selecting another question.

**Emma Bostian:** Maybe let's try "What a Character" for 200, please.

**Jerod Santo:** What a Character for 200. Full of opinions, this developer rose to fame by looking at different JavaScript snippets and saying "Whaet?!"

**Emma Bostian:** \[40:05\] Um... Define fame. \[laughter\]

**Scott Tolinski:** I know, yeah... \[laughs\]

1:Full of opinions, this developer rose to \*quote-unquote\* fame by looking at different JavaScript snippets and saying "Whaet?!"

**Emma Bostian:** Um, who is Mark Dalgleish? \[correct sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, shoot.

**Emma Bostian:** Wait, really?

**Jerod Santo:** Wrong button. \[fail sound\]

**Emma Bostian:** No...! \[laughter\] I was like, I had no idea.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh... Let me double that up there. \[fail sound\] Incorrect. Nick for a steal?

**Nick Nisi:** Yes. Who is Gary Bernhardt?

**Jerod Santo:** That is correct, Gary Bernhardt.

**Emma Bostian:** Watch Scott being answered to one of these questions.

**Scott Tolinski:** That'd be dope.

**Jerod Santo:** Nick, it is your turn, sir.

**Nick Nisi:** Alright, let's do... Oh, no. I'll do Frameswork for 200, please.

**Jerod Santo:** Frameswork for 200. This Model-View-ViewModel based framework was released in July 5th 2010. It was a big hit in and around Microsoft.

**Nick Nisi:** What...? I have no idea, so I'm just gonna say "What is Backbone?" \[fail sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** Incorrect.

**Scott Tolinski:** That's a good guess.

**Jerod Santo:** That's a good guess, yes. Scott has an opportunity to steal.

**Scott Tolinski:** Model-View-ViewModel...

**Jerod Santo:** Released on July 5th, 2010. It was a big hit in and around Microsoft.

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah, 2010... What was I doing in 2010? I'm gonna pass, because I don't know.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, Emma for the steal.

**Emma Bostian:** What is Ember JS?

**Jerod Santo:** \[fail sound\] I'm sorry, that is incorrect. The Model-View-ViewModel based framework that was big around Microsoft was Knockout.js.

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh yeah, Knockout. I remember you.

**Emma Bostian:** We used that...

**Jerod Santo:** There you go.

**Nick Nisi:** You could have really thrown us for a loop and say that it was a knockout around Microsoft. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** I said that it was a big hit.

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh, that is good, yeah. Dang. That is very good.

**Jerod Santo:** Thank you. I'm trying to throw you guys bones, but not be too obvious... Come on. Alright, whose was that? That was Nick's?

**Nick Nisi:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** That means we are back to Scott. Scott, let's select a question.

**Scott Tolinski:** Let's do Frameswork for 300.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Don't call it a framework... This platform for robotics and IoT was first released by Bocoup in 2012.

**Scott Tolinski:** Robotics? What?! Don't call it a -- this platform, IoT... What is NodeRed? \[fail sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** That's a good guess. IoT is definitely a place that NodeRed plays... But it's incorrect. Emma, would you like to steal? Robotics... Keyword, robotics. Not to give you too much help...

**Emma Bostian:** Um, I'm gonna pass. But before I pass, Jerod, I just wanna say we're all in the negative, so this should just reflect on you. \[laughter\] That's all.

**Scott Tolinski:** I'm smart, I should \[unintelligible 00:42:57.02\]

**Jerod Santo:** Ouch... Ouch. Well, you know, trivia is tough.

**Nick Nisi:** You said that early. I'm moving into the positives right now. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, Nick for the steal.

**Nick Nisi:** What is Johnny-Five?

**Jerod Santo:** This is correct.

**Scott Tolinski:** The hell is Johnny-Five?

**Emma Bostian:** It sounds like a Cartoon Network show.

**Jerod Santo:** It is a robotics and IoT platform first released by Bocoup in 2012. It was a very popular thing for controlling bots.

**Scott Tolinski:** \[laughs\] Dang it.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. We are on to Emma... I should give a score update at this point. Scott has -600. Remember, this is double trouble... Emma has -600 in this round, and Nick has 400 in this round. We will add the two rounds together at the end and see where we stand. Emma, your turn.

**Emma Bostian:** I'm gonna just go big or go home. Let's do Important for 500, please.

**Jerod Santo:** You can display an ordered list in its opposite order by setting this property on the element.

**Emma Bostian:** Uuh...

**Jerod Santo:** You can display an ordered list in its opposite order by setting this property on the element.

**Emma Bostian:** I don't know, because I feel like I would do this with Flexbox -- not for an ordered list, but maybe "What is list order?" \[fail sound\]

**Scott Tolinski:** That was a good guess.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, I didn't know. I had no idea.

**Jerod Santo:** Good guess. We go to Nick for an opportunity to steal.

**Nick Nisi:** \[44:15\] I'm gonna pass.

**Jerod Santo:** We go to Scott for the steal.

**Scott Tolinski:** Big pass.

**Jerod Santo:** The property you can set directly on an ordered list to reverse the order is "reversed".

**Emma Bostian:** I was gonna guess that too, and I was like "No, it's too easy. There's no way."

**Scott Tolinski:** No, thank you.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. We are on to Nick. Your turn, sir.

**Nick Nisi:** Alright, let's go to Frameswork for 400, please.

**Jerod Santo:** Angular's big 2.0 announcement backfired, because developers were angry over this major hurdle.

**Nick Nisi:** What is incompatibility with Angular 1?

**Jerod Santo:** That is correct! Backwards-compatibility, upgrade paths... People were very angry with Angular 2.0. You get 400 for that answer, and we move to Scott.

**Scott Tolinski:** Okay... You know, I'm already in the hole big time. I'm not gonna get out of it without big moneys...

**Emma Bostian:** That's where I'm at... \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** This is true, this is true.

**Scott Tolinski:** So Frameswork 500, let's do it!

**Jerod Santo:** Frameswork for 500. This new framework described itself as a Rails-like framework for monolithic full-stack React apps without an API?

**Scott Tolinski:** What is Blitz.js?

**Jerod Santo:** Correct! Very good. That brings you back out of the negatives for this round.

**Scott Tolinski:** Wooh! This is the first positives I've seen in a long time.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Emma, your turn.

**Emma Bostian:** I'm so unconfident in all of these... How about "What a Character" for 300?

**Jerod Santo:** Curious about style? Ask the creator and maintainer of JavaScript's standard.

**Emma Bostian:** Uhhhh...

**Jerod Santo:** Curious about style?

**Emma Bostian:** Who is Rachel Andrews?

**Jerod Santo:** I'm sorry, that is incorrect. Nick, would you like to steal?

**Nick Nisi:** Absolutely not.

**Jerod Santo:** Nick hard passes. Scott, for the steal?

**Scott Tolinski:** Hard pass. Double hard pass.

**Jerod Santo:** Double hard pass. Well, I would say that this one is most insulting, as JavaScript's standard style maintainer is JS Party panelist Feross Aboukhadijeh.

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh, no... \[laughs\]

**Emma Bostian:** Well, he ain't here, is he, so...

**Jerod Santo:** No, he's not here.

**Scott Tolinski:** I'm the guest, so I shouldn't have known that, so...

**Jerod Santo:** No, I wouldn't blame you, Scott. I'd blame Nick and Emma.

**Emma Bostian:** Are you throwing us under the bus right now?

**Jerod Santo:** I think you just threw Feross under the bus. Okay. Moving on. Sorry, Feross. We'll get you next time. Nick, it is your turn.

**Nick Nisi:** Alright, Npm-Install for 500.

**Jerod Santo:** He's going big, and he might be going home.

**Scott Tolinski:** Yes, hopefully.

**Jerod Santo:** Last published two years ago, and once the center of a major controversy, this package still has over five million downloads in the past week.

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, no... That's like every package.

**Scott Tolinski:** I know... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Fair, fair...

**Nick Nisi:** \[laughs\] Oh, man... Last published two years ago... Center of a major controversy... I'm gonna say "What is Leftpad?" \[correct sound\] Oh, yes!

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** You are correct, sir. And yet, five million downloads in the past week. It is still going strong. Okay, so 1,100 for Nick, and we go back to Scott.

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh, boy. Let's do Frameswork for 100.

**Jerod Santo:** Scott likes the frameworks. One way, two way, or no way. This controversial feature of many UI frameworks has inspired many blog posts over the years.

**Scott Tolinski:** Controversial feature... What is data binding?

**Jerod Santo:** Correct! Very good.

**Emma Bostian:** That's what I would have said, too. Well, you gave him an easy one.

**Scott Tolinski:** It's 100.

**Jerod Santo:** It was 100.

**Emma Bostian:** I know...

**Jerod Santo:** It's your turn, Emma. There's three more one-hundreds out there if you'd like to go for them... \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** I'll be fine, we'll do Important for 200, please.

**Jerod Santo:** For 200?

**Emma Bostian:** \[47:59\] Yeah, I'm just gonna keep complaining anyway. \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. "Not allowed", "wait" and "help" are all possible values of this CSS property.

**Emma Bostian:** What is cursor? \[correct sound\]

**Jerod Santo:** Good job! That was a tough one.

**Emma Bostian:** I only knew that because of "not allowed".

**Scott Tolinski:** That was tough, yeah.

**Emma Bostian:** I didn't know "wait" and "help", but I knew "not allowed".

**Jerod Santo:** I tried to grab more obscure ones, but when I was reading it back, I was like "Dang, this is way harder than I thought it was", so that's a good job. Way to get it. Okay, to Nick.

**Nick Nisi:** Okay, let's do -- I have a commanding lead... "What a Character" for 400, please.

**Jerod Santo:** What a Character, for 400. Backbone and \_dotjs made him known, CoffeeScript made him (some say) infamous.

**Nick Nisi:** Who is Jeremy Ashkenas?

**Jerod Santo:** Correct! Very good. Your commanding lead just got more commending. Scott, it is your turn.

**Emma Bostian:** Hey, Jerod.

**Scott Tolinski:** Yes.

**Emma Bostian:** Jerod, I don't know if you added my points from my cursor.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, my apologies. Let me go back to that.

**Emma Bostian:** I need every point I can possibly get.

**Jerod Santo:** Sorry, let me go here...

**Emma Bostian:** It's all good, I just wanted you to know I'm not -1,100 anymore.

**Jerod Santo:** I gotcha, my bad. Lots to juggle here. I wonder how Alex Trebek does it. Okay, whose turn is it and what are we doing?

**Scott Tolinski:** It's me.

**Jerod Santo:** Scott's, okay.

**Scott Tolinski:** Let's do Npm-Install for 100.

**Jerod Santo:** Npm-Install for 100. This utility library is the number one most depended-upon package on Npm.

**Scott Tolinski:** Utility library, the number one most depended-upon package. Utility library... What is Lodash?

**Jerod Santo:** Very good! What is Lodash.

**Nick Nisi:** Isn't Npm on Npm? Couldn't Npm be the answer?

**Scott Tolinski:** Is it a utility library?

**Nick Nisi:** It's THE utility...

**Scott Tolinski:** It's a CLI.

**Jerod Santo:** If you go to Npm's Explore stuff, you'll find that they list Lodash as their number one depended on... So no, Nick, it can't be.

**Scott Tolinski:** Wrong.

**Jerod Santo:** Back to Emma. I will dock you points if you do that again.

**Emma Bostian:** I feel like I need some points, so I feel like I should just go hard, maybe... Let's go like "What a Character" for 500, because I've been so successful already with that category...

**Jerod Santo:** This full-time open sourcerer has over 900 source repos on GitHub and over 1,100 Npm packages. They are prolific indeed.

**Scott Tolinski:** That's a lot of packages.

**Emma Bostian:** I have no idea, so I'm just gonna guess Jessie Frazelle. \[fail sound\] I know she does open source, so it was the only person I knew. \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** We will subtract 500 from your score. And Nick for the steal? Everybody will know this person once the name comes out...

**Nick Nisi:** Yeah, his picture has him as a dinosaur... I'm trying to think of his name though. I'm gonna pass because I can't think of his name right now.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Scott, would you like to steal?

**Scott Tolinski:** No, not a chance.

**Jerod Santo:** The full-time open sourcerer that has over 900 source repos on GitHub and over 1,100 Npm packages is Sindre Sorhus... Or I don't know if that's how you say the name.

**Scott Tolinski:** I would never have gotten that.

**Emma Bostian:** I have no idea who that is. I have never heard that name before.

**Scott Tolinski:** Likewise.

**Emma Bostian:** But it sounds like--

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, I take it back. I thought everybody would know that one.

**Emma Bostian:** No...

**Nick Nisi:** He is a dinosaur.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, he is. You've used his software, I guarantee it.

**Scott Tolinski:** Definitely, yeah. Alright, let's do Important for 100.

**Jerod Santo:** This property specifies the stack order of an element.

**Scott Tolinski:** Specifies the stack order of an element... Is it of this property -- oh, I see. What is z-index?

**Jerod Santo:** Very good!

**Nick Nisi:** I think I got skipped there, but that's okay.

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh, shoot. Sorry.

**Nick Nisi:** It's okay...

**Scott Tolinski:** I'm hyped up caffeine, I'm bouncing all over the place here. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Your commanding lead can handle it. Okay, we'll go to Emma. We have one left in "What a Character" and we have for "Can I Use". People do not like this category.

**Emma Bostian:** I'm really struggling, so let's just go out flaming. How about "Can I use" for 500.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, she goes for the gusto. Even Apple is experimenting with this image format, that supports lossy and lossless compression, as well as animation and alpha transparency.

**Emma Bostian:** \[52:13\] Oh... I know this, because I've just read the Image Performance book... Shoot. Oh, no...

**Jerod Santo:** Even Apple is experimenting with this image format, that supports lossy and lossless compression, as well as animation and alpha transparency.

**Emma Bostian:** I'm gonna be really mad at myself, because I know the answer, but I can't remember the actual name of it... So I'm gonna have to say I have no idea.

**Nick Nisi:** I'm gonna try. What is WebP? \[correct sound\]

**Emma Bostian:** Yup, that's exactly what I was gonna say. That makes me so angry.

**Jerod Santo:** You got it, what is WebP. Nice steal. Apple drag their feet on this for years, and they're finally experimenting with it. Okay, so we're into four more choices in round two, and we go to Nick.

**Nick Nisi:** "Can I Use" for 400, please.

**Jerod Santo:** 6% of browsers will let you bring your favorite browser tabbed life with this newish feature.

**Nick Nisi:** Uh, what is animated favicon.

**Jerod Santo:** Um...

**Emma Bostian:** Don't give it to him.

**Jerod Santo:** I'm not gonna give it to you. \[fail sound\] You're very close, but your winning. We'll go to Scott for the steal?

**Scott Tolinski:** Pass.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, he passes.

**Scott Tolinski:** \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** I was gonna let you have the steal.

**Scott Tolinski:** I don't know what it is.

**Emma Bostian:** I'm gonna swipe left.

**Jerod Santo:** I assume that means you're passing?

**Emma Bostian:** Yes.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. \[laughter\] The correct answer, which you were very close to, is SVG favicons.

**Nick Nisi:** Oh...

**Jerod Santo:** And of course, you can animate an SVG favicon... So - almost had it, but no cigar. Okay, to Scott.

**Emma Bostian:** Um, could you subtract his point value, Jerod?

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, he sure did.

**Jerod Santo:** Did I?

**Nick Nisi:** Yeah.

**Emma Bostian:** Do it again.

**Jerod Santo:** I just did it again. \[laughter\]

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah, just do it once more.

**Jerod Santo:** What's your correct score? 1,600?

**Scott Tolinski:** 1,600, yeah. I was at 2,000 before that.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. So top of the order here, I should say... For round two we have Scott at 500, Emma at -1,900, Nick at 1,600, and I will note that these scores will double before getting added to round one. Scott, your turn, sir.

**Scott Tolinski:** "Can I Use" for 200, please.

**Jerod Santo:** Can I Use for 200. All major browsers support the prefetch resource hint, except this pesky laggard.

**Emma Bostian:** \[laughs\] I like that.

**Scott Tolinski:** All major browsers support the prefetch... Wait, was the hint an actual hint? Oh, resource hint.

**Jerod Santo:** Resource hint.

**Scott Tolinski:** I didn't read this. Okay. Except for this pesky laggard... What is Safari? \[correct sound\] It's a reasonable guess. They suck at everything, so...

**Emma Bostian:** \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Very reasonable guess, and the correct answer. Okay. Emma, you have "Can I Use" for 300 or "What a Character for 100".

**Emma Bostian:** How about "What a Character" for 100? \[laughter\] I have destroyed this whole category...

**Jerod Santo:** You're so depressed. This Twitter account playfully stirs up mischief by taking people's statements out of context.

**Emma Bostian:** Um... I have no idea.

**Jerod Santo:** This Twitter account playfully stirs up mischief by taking people's statements out of context.

**Nick Nisi:** Sounds like every Twitter account, right?

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah... \[laughter\] I don't know... What is I Am Devloper? I have no freakin' clue.

**Scott Tolinski:** I thought that was a good guess.

**Jerod Santo:** That is a good guess.

**Emma Bostian:** Thanks.

**Jerod Santo:** Nick will know this one.

**Nick Nisi:** Yeah. Who is Horse JS?

**Emma Bostian:** Oh, that was my other option.

**Jerod Santo:** \[correct sound\] I should have got an animal reference in there somehow, so you knew that it was a horse... \[laughter\] Sorry, I'm critiquing my questions here, as we go. Okay last one of the round, and it goes to Nick. "Can I Use" for 300 - are you ready?

**Nick Nisi:** Ready.

**Jerod Santo:** This API for complex rendering and compute using hardware acceleration has 0% browser support.

**Nick Nisi:** Oh, no...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. \[laughs\] You can use it on 0% of browsers.

**Nick Nisi:** \[56:15\] Um... This is a total shot in the dark, but I'm gonna say "What is Houdini?" \[fail sound\] I figured.

**Jerod Santo:** Any steals? We go to Scott for the steal?

**Scott Tolinski:** Nope.

**Jerod Santo:** Emma for the steal?

**Scott Tolinski:** Just no. No.

**Jerod Santo:** The correct answer - the API for complex rendering and compute, using hardware acceleration, that has 0% browser share is WebGPU.

**Scott Tolinski:** WebGPU... I knew it was something about WebGL, but...

**Jerod Santo:** This is supposed to be supplanting and superseding WebGL in 3D games, and using accelerated stuff. It's brand new, it has 0% share. It was a tough question, and Nick failed at it.

That's the end or round two. We have for round two - Scott scores 1,400...

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah!

**Jerod Santo:** Emma scores -4,000. \[laughter\] And Nick scores 2,800. We'll come back for Final Trouble right after this.

**Break:** \[57:21\]

**Jerod Santo:** We are back for Final Trouble... And a couple of our contestants are in a lot of trouble. After tallying rounds one and two, we have Emma with -3,500, our special guest Scott Tolinski at -1,400, and Nick Nisi with 2,700. We now move to Final Trouble, in which I list a category, you all submit private wagers to me of how much you wager, I ask the question, and then you submit private answers for us to tally.

The category of choice is Offline First. Your category for Final Trouble is Offline First. Please submit to me your wagers.

Okay, the wagers are in. This is the question for Final Trouble, Offline First: This open source JavaScript database was created to help web developers build applications that work as well offline as they do online.

One more time - this is the question for Final Trouble, Offline First: This open source JavaScript database was created to help web developers build applications that work as well offline as they do online. Please submit to me your answers.

**Scott Tolinski:** I've got two of them, going back and forth...

**Jerod Santo:** We are waiting for Emma.

**Emma Bostian:** \[laughs\] I have no idea.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, all the answers are in. The wagers are tallied. The math makes no sense, but we're doing this thing. With a wager of 101.895 Euros..

**Emma Bostian:** No, that was a hundred one thousand eight hundred ninety-five.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, you use a decimal point as a separator.

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah, that's what they use in Europe, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Gosh, okay... \[laughter\]

**Scott Tolinski:** Oh, gosh...

**Jerod Santo:** Emma's answer - what is Elastic Search? \[correct sound\] \[fail sound\] \[fail sound\] I hit the wrong button. \[laughter\] Too much pressure. That answer is wrong, and that point total is ridiculous. You now have negative infinity points.

Up next, special guest Scott Tolinski wagered 100% of his points, so 1,400 points on the line, and he says "I'm wagering whatever makes me beat Emma."

**Scott Tolinski:** I don't wanna get last place. \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** His answer, "What is CouchDB?" was a valiant guess. \[fail sound\]

**Scott Tolinski:** No...

**Jerod Santo:** And so, he ends up his game at 0. Or -2,800, depending on how you do math.

**Scott Tolinski:** Whatever...

**Jerod Santo:** But way better than negative infinity. Which means Nick Nisi, who wagered 2,700... This is all your points, Nick?

**Nick Nisi:** It is. I should have done one less.

**Jerod Santo:** He answered "What is Firebase?" \[fail sound\] Answer fail, and wager fail, because you could have left money on the table, and gotten first place, but now you've tied with Scott, in the most ridiculous game of JS Danger in human history. \[laughter\]

The correct answer, of course - Scott was off literally by one letter... The correct answer, the open source database is called PouchDB.

**Scott Tolinski:** What?!

**Nick Nisi:** Oh...!

**Emma Bostian:** \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** Inspired by CouchDB, CouchDB aims to help web developers build applications that work as well offline as they do online. Well, this has been something else...

**Emma Bostian:** Enlightening. Enlightening.

**Scott Tolinski:** Yeah!

**Jerod Santo:** We hope you enjoyed it. We had a lot of fun for this edition of JS Danger game. Remember, here at JS Party, Danger is our middle name. I wanna say special thanks to Scott Tolinski for joining us. Thanks as always to regular panelists, Nick Nisi and Emma Bostian. That's our show, we'll talk to you next time!

**Break:** \[01:02:44.13\]

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, wait a second... I've gotta start over. Because Scott, you have negative as well.

**Emma Bostian:** What?! Ha-ha-ha...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, I wrote you down with 1,400, but you have negative--

**Scott Tolinski:** I have 1,400.

**Jerod Santo:** Wait...

**Emma Bostian:** Welcome...!

**Jerod Santo:** You had -2,800, plus 1,400. Oh yeah, you're at 1,400. You're right. No, you're at -1,400. What am I doing here? Shoot, we've got two people in the negatives. How does the game work? How does Jeopardy work if you have two people in the red? I think they just lose.

**Emma Bostian:** That's why I'm thinking, just let us wager whatever we want. If it works, it works, and if it doesn't, it doesn't. It's not like we're actually winning money, Jerod...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, I know that... \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** Just bragging rights.

**Jerod Santo:** Just bragging rights... Yeah, but Nick's been beating you guys, and you're gonna just wipe that out and say "Well, I'm gonna wager..." I'm trying to think out loud here.

**Emma Bostian:** I'd just let us wager any amount of money we want. No limits. If Nick's cool with it, because he's in the lead, so... It's up to him.

**Nick Nisi:** Sure. Steal it from me, that's fine.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] What do you think, Nick?

**Nick Nisi:** No, that's fine. That's fine, I don't care.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Emma Bostian:** Mine is gonna be in Euro though, Jerod. Is that okay?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Totally.

**Nick Nisi:** Mine's gonna be in Bitcoin.

**Jerod Santo:** You might as well... The points don't mean anything. \[laughter\] I'm gonna list off our point totals, and then I'm gonna explain Final Trouble, and then I'm gonna act as if this isn't broken, and we're gonna do the thing. Ready? \[laughter\]

**Emma Bostian:** Yeah...

**Scott Tolinski:** Let's do it!
