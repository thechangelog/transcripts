**Jerod Santo:**

What up, nerds? I'm Jerod and this is Changelog News for the week of Monday, November 24th, 2025.

[Turns out](https://sherwood.news/culture/the-worlds-most-common-passwords-usually-follow-the-same-formula) Gen Z has a weaker top password choice than every older generation except the 80+ crowd. Don't get cocky Boomers, Gen X-ers, and Millenials. It's pretty rocky for us, too. 

According to [a new report](https://nordpass.com/most-common-passwords-list/), the most commonly leaked Gen Z password is "12345", while the most commonly leaked passwords for the other age groups is "12345**6**" 

This proves that you can be both a winner and a loser at the same time.

Ok, let's get into this week's news.

[What is a tech bubble anyway?](https://commoncog.com/what-is-a-tech-bubble/)

Cedric Chin says comparisons of our current AI *maybe-bubble* to the dot-com bubble and the 2008 GFC are limiting:

> First, the 2008 crisis wasn’t a technology bubble. Second, the dot-com bubble was idiosyncratic for a number of reasons, the biggest one being that going public has since become an order-magnitude more difficult...
>
> it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the hottest AI companies today are all private companies, unavailable to the retail investor. That’s different enough from 1999 that it should, I think, give you pause.

Cedric also believes that calling this a bubble or not doesn't really matter. What really matters is, "*what should I do?*" That, of course, depends on who *you* are and what *you* are trying to accomplish. Leaving the subjective aside, I'm linking up Cedric's post because he provides five bullet points that lay out a pattern we can use to see what might come next.

Unfortunately, each bullet point is too long to inline here and not long enough to summarize in a useful way. So, I'm not going to *"save you a click"* on this one.

[The Cloudflare outage, unwrapped](https://blog.cloudflare.com/18-november-2025-outage/)

*Filed Under: "Stories You Most Likely Already Know All About"*

Cloudflare CEO, Matthew Prince, posted an excellently transparent post-mortem of their "significant failures to deliver core network traffic" last week which brought much of the internet to its knees (and our AI agents with it). The details are fascinating. [Murphy's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law) was in full effect that day:

> Throwing us off and making us believe this might have been an attack was another apparent symptom we observed: Cloudflare’s status page went down. The status page is hosted completely off Cloudflare’s infrastructure with no dependencies on Cloudflare. While it turned out to be a coincidence, it led some of the team diagnosing the issue to believe that an attacker may be targeting both our systems as well as our status page.

The smoking gun at the end of this murder mystery was a single line of Rust code which executes a single method: ".unwrap()"

It just so happens that "unwrap", which assumes an operation succeeded and extracts data from its inner value, is considered by many Rustaceans to be one of the language's few footguns. Cloudflare engineering shot themselves with it. And the internet felt the pain.

[A high-performance log viewer for humans](https://github.com/pamburus/hl)

"hl" is a fast, powerful log viewer / processor that converts JSON and logfmt logs into a clear, human-readable format before we do our own parsing and analysis. It has paging built in, can handle streaming logs, lets you filter by fields, log levels, or timestamps, includes a follow mode, and more.

This isn't the first "log viewer for humans" on the block, but it does stand out from the crowd in their [provided benchmark](https://github.com/pamburus/hl?tab=readme-ov-file#performance) comparing "hl" to alternatives on a 2.3 GB log file. "hl" opened the 6M line log in ~1.1 seconds compared to [hlogf](https://github.com/ssgreg/hlogf)'s ~8.7 seconds, [humanlog](https://github.com/humanlogio/humanlog)'s ~79 seconds, and [fblog](https://github.com/brocode/fblog)'s ~34 seconds.

It's now time for sponsored news!

[Give your GitHub Actions a serious speed boost](https://namespace.so)

Your current GitHub Actions setup is doing the job, but it's also taking way longer than it should. Every time you push code, you're watching the spinner on 10+ minute builds. Not fun. Namespace flips the script by giving you infrastructure designed from the ground up for fast builds.

All you have to do is point your existing workflows at Namespace runners instead of the default GitHub-hosted runners, and instantly those 10+ minute builds drop to minutes. Behind the scenes, Namespace is handling incremental caching, parallel execution of independent jobs, and optimized Docker layer caching.

The cost difference is also dramatic. Namespace's model gives you predictable pricing and they're built for teams that ship constantly. Instead of watching spinners, they're shipping features.

Head to [Namespace.so](https://namespace.so), stop watching spinners, get faster builds, and get more of your time back for real work.

[Continuum 93](https://enthusiastguy.itch.io/continuum93)

This is kinda insane...

> Continuum 93 is an emulator of a classic retro computer that never existed before and is designed for retro games programming in native assembly code.

Yes, you heard that correctly. This is a *fantasy* computer emulator, which means it is emulating a computer that never was, but certainly *could* have been, and perhaps *should* have been, but again: it was not. But now it is? My head hurts.

Continuum 93 was recently open sourced, runs on "Windows, Mac, Linux, all 64 bit Raspberry Pi and Steam Deck", and is created by a guy whose handle is "Enthusiast Guy", which is so apropos my headache went away.

[Things that aren't doing the thing](https://strangestloop.io/essays/things-that-arent-doing-the-thing)

The only thing that is doing the thing is doing the thing. You already know that. I already know that. But sometimes we need a reminder, don't we? Here's your reminder!

> Making a to-do list for the thing isn't doing the thing.

> Telling people you're going to do the thing isn't doing the thing.

> Fantasizing about all of the adoration you'll receive once you do the thing isn't doing the thing.

You get the point, but if you want to drill it in to your head by reading even more things that aren't the thing, click through. Or, stop reading Changelog News and just go do the thing ;)
