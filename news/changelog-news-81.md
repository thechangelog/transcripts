I wanted to announce our fresh [Changelog Beats](https://changelog.com/beats) on last week's episode, but Apple Music didn't approve it until I'd already hit publish. I guess that's just life in the walled garden. Oh well, introducing.... [Dance Party](https://changelog.com/beats/dance-party)! Enjoy the drop

This album bundles 21 BMC bangers such as Tetris Schmetris.... Miami Bites 1984.... Pole Reposition... and Paul Oakenfold Fights Moby in the Alley Behind a Pan-Asian Restaurant....

Listen now on Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, YouTube Music... all the musics! Of course there's a direct link to all the goodness in this week's newsletter and in the chapter data. Go ahead and get ya groove on.

Will McGugan from Textualize has a new terminal app called "toolong" (tl for short), which lets you view, tail, merge & search log files (plus JSONL) in a "snappy, straightforward to use" way. Here's _why_ he made it:

> I spent a lot of time in my past life as a web developer working with logs, typically on web servers via ssh. I would use a variety of tools, but my goto method of analyzing logs was directly on the server with \*nix tools like `tail`, `less`, and `grep` etc. As useful as these tools are, they are not without friction.
>
> I built toolong to be the tool I would have wanted back then.

  I'm somewhat ashamed to say I still use those tools and have been for toolong. Maybe I should give toolong a try instead.

Diane Brady writes for Fortune:

> Mozilla Corp. ... announced today that Mitchell Baker is stepping down as CEO to focus on AI and internet safety as chair of the nonprofit foundation. Laura Chambers, a Mozilla board member and entrepreneur with experience at Airbnb, PayPal, and eBay, will step in as interim CEO to run operations until a permanent replacement is found.

The short-term plan, according to Chambers (who has an open invitation to The Changelog) is:

> to focus on building out new products that address growing privacy concerns while actively looking for a full-time CEO.

New products. AI tools. What next, _Mozilla Vision Pro_?! Here's where I'd focus if I were Mozilla CEO: making Firefox _so good_ it does to Chrome what it did to Internet Explorer not so long ago...

It's now time for Sponsored News!

Are you using Kafka in production and looking for something significantly simpler yet more cost effective that can easily extend to the edge?

NATS is becoming the go-to alternative that satisfies Kafka's use cases, but does **much more than streaming**.

Stateless messaging? Request-reply? Key-value storage? Object storage? NATS does that!

Synadia is helping teams get beyond the assumption that “Kafka is the default” by showing how NATS can take their applications to the next level. Learn more and try it out for free by going to https://synadia.com/changelog

> We’re excited to announce the release of Sudo for Windows in Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 26052! Sudo for Windows is a new way for users to run elevated commands directly from an unelevated console session. It is an ergonomic and familiar solution for users who want to elevate a command without having to first open a new elevated console.

It's also [open source](https://github.com/microsoft/sudo), which is how I know it clocks in at ~75 lines of PowerShell and is in no way a fork or a port of Linux's `sudo`, just a reimplementation of the concept for Windows. Before you know it, they'll be ditching those [trashy backslashes](https://youtu.be/pc-KKJUf3q4) and adopting the simple slash (no need to say the forward bit) too!

Tatu Ylonenqqq, author of the original SSH, tells the tale of how they got SSH to be port 22.

> I wrote the initial version of SSH (Secure Shell) in Spring 1995. It was a time when telnet and FTP were widely used.
>
> Anyway, I designed SSH to replace both telnet (port 23) and ftp (port 21). Port 22 was free. It was conveniently between the ports for telnet and ftp. I figured having that port number might be one of those small things that would give some aura of credibility. But how could I get that port number?

The internet was much smaller back then, so the process was straight forward (but still intimidating). It boils down to a well-worded email to the IANA (which is included verbatim in the post) and voila!

Jack Lindamood wrote up what he calls "Almost every infrastructure decision I endorse or regret after 4 years running infrastructure at a startup." In the ~20 minute read, Jack gives an Endorse or Regret rating to ~50 different services, tools & processes. Here's a sampler platter:

- 🟩 Endorse: GitOps
- 🟥 Regret: Multiple applications sharing a database
- 🟩 Endorse: Notion
- 🟩 Endorse: Slack
- 🟥 Regret: Datadog
- 🟥 Regret: Not using open telemetry early

And a special treat for our Changelog++ members today, you also get the full meal. Yes, I read all 50 ratings for everyone who directly supports our work with their hard-earned cash. Whew, that was exhausting. Treat yourself at changelog.com/++
