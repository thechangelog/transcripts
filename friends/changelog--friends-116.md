**Jerod Santo:** Welcome once again to \#define, our game show all about fake, obscure, jargon definitions, tomfoolery, and people who generally know way too much about words. Also, Adam and I are here...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, I'm here today. Again.

**Jerod Santo:** We are joined by our champions. This is going to be a -- I was going to say a Duke Nukem, because that's on my mind, but... What's the name of that game where they all punch each other? Oh, a Rock'em Sock'em Robots of \#define, because everybody here except for Adam and myself have actually won the game. We tried to get all of our \#define champs, but of course, scheduling is hard, and so Lars and Carol couldn't make it... But we are joined today by our previous winners, starting with the person who won most recent -- not first, because that was Lars, but first right after him - it's Taylor Troesh. What's up, Taylor?

**Adam Stacoviak:** First right after him. Second. You know? \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, you're right. Second would work there.

**Taylor Troesh:** I lost in the first round... Yeah, how's it going?

**Jerod Santo:** You did, but you came back and you were victorious after that.. And then did you lose to Carol after that, or did we boot you?

**Taylor Troesh:** I think I lost to Carol and then you got tired of me.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. So we're not tired of you, we're back... You're back... We've invited you back. And I'm sure you're going to give it a go. After Taylor is Thomas. Ooh, Jonathan Taylor Thomas... We should get a Jonathan here, and have a JTT shout-out from the nineties. What's up, Thomas? How you doing, man?

**Thomas Eckert:** I'm doing well. It's good to catch up with everyone, and... Yeah, happy to be back here. I think it's good for all of us that Carol did not join, because she destroyed me last time I played.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right. So you are a -- you're one for two in winning, which is slightly better than Taylor... But not quite as good as Matthew, who's one for one. Aren't you, Matthew?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah. I was going to decline this to keep my record, but... \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** "I'm busy..."

**Matthew Sanabria:** I'm so busy...

**Adam Stacoviak:** "I'm going to keep my belts, okay...?"

**E. David Aja:** You can't keep the belt if you don't fight for the belt.

**Adam Stacoviak:** You can't take away what I can't lose.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right. Well, if you don't show up, then you actually lose by default... And so I'm glad that you're here to defend your title, and then potentially take these guys's title. And lastly is our most recent winner... It's David Aja. David, welcome back.

**E. David Aja:** Glad to be back.

**Adam Stacoviak:** What's up, David?

**E. David Aja:** You know, I'm chilling. I'm excited. I'm ready to earn the masters in BS. I feel like I got the BS in BS. Let's take it to the next level.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Nice.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Always BS-ing.

**Jerod Santo:** If you win a third time, we get you the PhD, the BS-HD. That didn't make any sense. Adam, why are you here? No, just kidding. So...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Ah... Solidarity, my friend. Solidarity.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] You're here because it's Changelog & Friends With Adam and Jerod, and so of course you are here.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right! I've gotta be.

**Jerod Santo:** And should we reveal the secret from the Changelog Plus Plus segment last time around? Do you want to get your comeuppance?

**Adam Stacoviak:** What was it? What am I revealing? What did I miss?

**Jerod Santo:** You won a round. You won it, remember? After we quit playing, we had a Changelog Plus Plus special...

**Adam Stacoviak:** And I won that one.

**Jerod Santo:** ...in which you beat David, and everybody else.

**Adam Stacoviak:** You've got to win in post shows, you know? If I'm going to win, I might as well do it when no one's listening.

**E. David Aja:** I would describe that win as a hallucination...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Well, it's funny you say that, because we are going to put a slight twist on this round in order to level the playing field. You know, Adam's a big fan of golf...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** And in golf there's handicaps, and there's also mulligans. And since you all are previous winners and Adam hasn't quite achieved that level yet, we're going to give him a slight handicap, which is that during this game, he can pick one round... He does not have to disclose, but for one round, he can actually use an LLM to generate his answer.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Mm-hm...

**Jerod Santo:** And that's it. So he gets to let a trick up his sleeve. He can deploy it whenever he wants. He doesn't have to... And he does not have to disclose it. That way, maybe... Who knows...? Maybe he'll be the champion of champions.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Should I not disclose it at all, or just not until I win the round?

**Jerod Santo:** Well, that card is in your hand, you can play it however you want.

**Taylor Troesh:** What do you mean "until you win the round"?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, if I'm leveraging an agent, there's no way I can lose.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, you might still lose the round.

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah, what are you talking about...?

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] It's not a guaranteed win.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, I mean... Have you seen my agents? Gosh...

**Taylor Troesh:** Well, then why don't you have wins already?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, because I don't use the agents there, buddy. That's why. I'm using my own brain, which is stupid. I use their brain, which is very smart. All the smarts there, all the stupid here.

**Jerod Santo:** We have a no Google policy, we have a no agent policy... Of course, don't look up the definitions, because that wouldn't be very fun at all. The way this game works is that we have 10 rounds of play, or playing to 12 points, whichever one comes first... And each round presents a word, which is obscure, hopefully - hopefully nobody knows it; maybe you know it - that is in the world of STEMy things. So it could be a science, medicine, it could be math, it could be music, it could be science fiction, it could be computer science, etc. They're just in that wheelhouse of science-y things. And a definition of the obscure word.

Now, after I name the word, everybody submits to me their definitions of what they think the word means. Or if they don't know what it means, they make one up in order to fool their enemies into selecting it. After the definitions are submitted, I will read them all, hopefully without laughing, and then you all go around and try to guess which one is the correct definition.

\[08:15\] Now, if you get the right definition initially, right away, you get three points and you set the round out. If you have the wrong definition, but other people pick yours, you get one point for each person who picks your definition. And then at the end of the round, if you happened upon the correct definition during the selection process, you get two points. So three, two, and one. If nobody selects the correct definition in a round, I, your humble host, get four points.

And the first one to 12 wins, or the person with the most points after all 10 rounds - I doubt we're going to have to do all 10 to get to 12, because David scored 12 in like 37 seconds last time. So... Any questions before we get into round one?

**Taylor Troesh:** No, let's go. Excited to get started.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Here we go. Your word for round one is iatragenic. Iatragenic . I-A-T-R-A-G-E-N-I-C, iatragenic. Please submit to me your definitions for iatragenic now. Is there a problem, Taylor?

**Taylor Troesh:** I know this one... I'm just trying to -- it's so close.

**Jerod Santo:** That's not a problem.

**Thomas Eckert:** Now, Jerod, have you considered using a text-to-speech solution for reading these definitions aloud, to avoid the laughter problem, the metagame?

**Jerod Santo:** That's a really good idea. I just feel like I would be really bored. \[unintelligible 00:10:01.12\]

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah. You don't want AI taking your job.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Fight for it.

**Jerod Santo:** I'm going to keep fighting. Alright, all definitions are in for iatragenic... And I will say right up front that Taylor has the correct definition. So three points for Taylor... And you can just relax, my friend. Good job. He did know it. He really knew it. So there are one, two, three, four... Five possible definitions for iatragenic. Number one, "Iatragenic describes natural springs which produce water with high concentrations of ionic water." Number two, "Iatragenic - caused inadvertently by medical treatment or diagnosis." Number three, "An object solely composed of distinct, dissimilar parts." Number four, "Describing cells in the endocrine system responsible for producing hormones." And number five, "The process of swapping out one gene pool for another." There you have it, five potential definitions for iatragenic. We start - since Taylor is resting, we start with Thomas.

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah. So looking at this list, we have the water ones, natural springs with ionic water... So like genic. I think about iatragenic, genic being like "to generate". I know that much. "Caused inadvertently by medical operation" was number two. A combination of distinct dissimilar parts, cells in the endocrine system, and then gene pool swapping.

**Jerod Santo:** That's good notes.

**Thomas Eckert:** Well, yeah. Thank you.

**Jerod Santo:** No, thank you, because normally people are like "What's number three again?"

**Thomas Eckert:** \[12:08\] \[laughs\] Okay. What really sticks out to me is the "Caused inadvertently." So number two is what I'm going to go with.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, Thomas goes with number two. How about Matthew?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Because you said something, I want you to repeat number three, actually.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Number three is "An object solely composed of distinct dissimilar parts", you jerk... \[laughter\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** Jerk... Is that in the definition?

**Jerod Santo:** That was for him. He's just trolling me. That was a troll. We all know what it was.

**Matthew Sanabria:** So the gene one, dissimilar parts, water, water... Repeated water twice, actually. So that was interesting. The gene pool one...

**Jerod Santo:** Number one, yeah.

**Matthew Sanabria:** There was one that's not the gene pool, not the water, not the dissimilar parts... There were two other definitions that I can't remember.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, gosh. So number four was describing cells in the endocrine system responsible for producing hormones.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** That's not gene pool, that's not...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Not gene pool, not dissimilar, not water, and not cells. There's that one other one.

**Jerod Santo:** Not cells. This is like a test for me...

**Matthew Sanabria:** There's that one -- this one right here.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Gotcha!

**Jerod Santo:** The process of swapping out one gene pool for another?

**Matthew Sanabria:** No, we said that one.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. "Caused inadvertently by medical treatment or diagnosis"?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah, I'm going to lock that one in.

**Jerod Santo:** That's the one?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yup.

**Jerod Santo:** So you're going to pile on with Thomas.

**Thomas Eckert:** Pile on...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Admittedly, I didn't catch which one Thomas picked, so... Yeah, it's a pile on.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. So it's an accidental pile-on. Fair. Alright, we go to David.

**E. David Aja:** I'm going to construct an additional pile-on.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] This guy doesn't just pile on, he constructs pile-ons. Alright, we've got three people on --

**Adam Stacoviak:** Now I'm scared.

**Jerod Santo:** ...number two, and we go to Adam... Who's the last one to actually guess.

**Adam Stacoviak:** What's the second to last one, Jerod?

**Jerod Santo:** That would be the fourth.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes. Can you read that one, please?

**Jerod Santo:** Describing cells in the endocrine system responsible for producing hormones.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, that's the one. That's the one right there. Let's dial that one in.

**Jerod Santo:** Are you gonna lock it?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, let's dial that one in.

**Jerod Santo:** Let's lock that one.

**Adam Stacoviak:** No breakfast ball required, fellas...

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Well, after round one, of course, Taylor gets the default three...

**Matthew Sanabria:** So Taylor, what's the correct answer, Taylor?

**Taylor Troesh:** The correct answer is the medical one. And the only reason I know it is from a Nassim Taleb book. I can't remember which one, but... He loves that word.

**Jerod Santo:** Really?

**Thomas Eckert:** Fooled by Randomness, or...?

**Taylor Troesh:** I don't remember. I haven't read one of his books in 10 years, or something.

**Jerod Santo:** I don't know either. Antifragile... Is that him?

**Taylor Troesh:** That's definitely him.

**Jerod Santo:** That sounds like something that would happen in there, because maybe you go in for an appointment and then you get misdiagnosed... And then you're stronger afterwards? No, that doesn't make sense. I don't know. Yes, that is the correct definition for iatragenic. It's when something's caused inadvertently by medical treatment or diagnosis. Taylor's definition was "Has the opposite intended effect, as in hospitals killing healthy patients." Very good. So Thomas, Matthew and David each correctly got that, so they each get two points. Thomas, Matthew and David. And then Adam, he did not pile on. He went for "Describing cells in the endocrine system responsible for producing hormones." That was David's. So an additional point...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Ah, good job, David.

**Taylor Troesh:** Good job, David.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Come out the gate with 12, right away.

**Jerod Santo:** He's coming out. He's on pace. He's on pace once again... And a successful round one. We have Taylor and David with three, Thomas and Matthew with two, and your humble hosts with zero. Moving to round two... In round two your word is... Heteroscedasticity. It's spelled H-E-T-E-R-O-S-C-E-D-A-S-T-I-C-I­-T-Y. I'll put that in chat...

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah, you need to put that in chat.

**Jerod Santo:** \[16:06\] I'll say it one more time... It's heteroscedasticity. There we go. Heteroscedasticity. That's tough.

**Thomas Eckert:** Matthew, is the Oxide T-shirt embroidered?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah, this one is.

**Thomas Eckert:** Ooph... Quality from end to end. That's not \[unintelligible 00:16:38.29\] t's embroidered. Wow...

**Jerod Santo:** I grabbed a couple of T-shirts while I was there, and they were -- I grabbed the XLs, went back to the hotel, I'm like "These are too big." I went and swapped them for larges... Got home and I'm like "Ah, these are too small." Now I don't know what to do. I wear them when I work out, it makes me look buff, you know? I love the 0X Engineer one. So cool.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah, \[unintelligible 00:17:01.14\]

**Jerod Santo:** Just me and Matthew have that problem with our arms. We just can't fit everything in, you know, our guns.

**Thomas Eckert:** The pipes...

**Jerod Santo:** Can't you tell? They're pretty much the same size...

**E. David Aja:** Have you considered working on anything other than the biceps? \[laughter\]

**Matthew Sanabria:** I considered it...

**Jerod Santo:** He'll keep it under advisement. So Adam, when you do decide to deploy your LLM-based answer, which language model are you going to use?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, gosh... Great question. I don't know, honestly... I don't know.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I just don't know.

**E. David Aja:** Have you played -- there's a Mac app called Chorus, that makes it easy for you to just fire the same question to a bunch of them at once...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, really?

**E. David Aja:** ...which, when I have things where it's like I don't actually care which model, I just want to try several at once. That's often kind of helpful.

**Jerod Santo:** That's pretty much what I do manually. I just like copy paste it into like three different prompts. So that was really something I might give a shot. I really like to go scorched earth and just maximize my compute on this particular...

**Thomas Eckert:** Literally scorch the earth...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Thomas Eckert:** "How could I maximize my carbon footprint?"

**Adam Stacoviak:** I was looking away. Was that you, David? Was that your voice I heard saying that? Who was it that said this tool? Was it David?

**Jerod Santo:** Chorus? That was David. Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's called Chorus. Like you're a chorus of people, is that right?

**E. David Aja:** Like a collection of people singing.

**Jerod Santo:** Is that chorus.ai?

**E. David Aja:** I do not remember the domain. I think if you just -- let me...

**Jerod Santo:** If you just ask all your LLMs, one will point you to the right place.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah... I've found a couple of Choruses that are not that. I'm trying to find that...

**E. David Aja:** Chorus.sh.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, they don't want you talking about it. Chorus.shh...

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's not what that means, Jerod...

**Jerod Santo:** Chorus dot -- what does it mean, shell?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, it's like a .sh file. A script.

**Jerod Santo:** That's why they made the TLD, was for shell scripts?

**Adam Stacoviak:** I don't know. That's how they're best being used...

**Jerod Santo:** Well, sure.

**Taylor Troesh:** It's probably for Shazakistan.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah...

**Jerod Santo:** Shazakistan... Or it could be Shazam. It could be Shaq's favorite movie about himself. He can afford TLD, I think... Anybody can.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, whoever did this website for Chorus is just... I like it. They did a great job.

**Taylor Troesh:** Adam, if you're looking for advice on LLMs, you should pick up a vintage. Go for like GPT 2.5... It's a nice Vintage.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's got a good taste?

**Jerod Santo:** What year is that?

**Taylor Troesh:** It's like a 2021 vintage...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] You might be correct. Alright, I have five definitions for heteroscedasticity, or however you say it...

**Thomas Eckert:** \[19:57\] You're getting better at it, though... The practice is paying off.

**Jerod Santo:** I feel like it.

**Thomas Eckert:** Good.

**Jerod Santo:** And by five, I mean five, not six, because one of us got it 100% correct... And that person is Mr. David Aja. Three points to David.

**E. David Aja:** I had to try really hard not to help you with the pronunciation...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, and he knows how to pronounce it, too... How am I doing?

**E. David Aja:** You got there.

**Jerod Santo:** Eventually. I have this pronunciation guide, and as I try to read the actual syllables, I can't -- it's just a lot of syllables. I couldn't quite put them together. Bu if you just look at the words - not so bad. Anyways, neither here nor there. Up first, this round -- well, let me read them. Gosh... You guys just guess the numbers. Might as well... Okay, five definitions for heteroscedasticity. Ah, shoot, I'm back. "A material that has differing shear resistance across its various dimensions."

That's number one. Number two, when molecules have multiple stable configurations. Number three, the process of fine-tuning multidimensional data structures into a single data store. Number four, a collection of disjoint operators which make up the order one manifold. And number five, a statistical property in which some subpopulations in a collection of random variables have different variabilities from others. There you go, five definitions. Heteroscedasticity. Let's start with Thomas.

**Thomas Eckert:** So the first one we have is this material with different shear...

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, shear resistance across its various dimensions.

**Thomas Eckert:** Across various dimensions, okay... So it makes sense that all of these do play into the prefix of the word, the hetero, right? ...of mixing up different things together.

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Thomas Eckert:** Number two, you have molecules with different... What were they?

**Jerod Santo:** Multiple stable configurations, yeah.

**Thomas Eckert:** Multiple stable configurations. Okay... Okay, that makes sense. For three, fine-tuning for multidimensional LLMs, or AI models...

**Jerod Santo:** Multidimensional data structures.

**Thomas Eckert:** Oh, data structures. I'm just throwing --

**Jerod Santo:** Process of fine-tuning multidimensional data structures into a single data store.

**Thomas Eckert:** You see, but I feel like this -city at the end is not necessarily like a process. So it's describing a state of something.

**Jerod Santo:** It's a city.

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah, but it's a city, not a state.

**Jerod Santo:** I beat you to that one, Taylor...

**Thomas Eckert:** And then what was the -- a collection... The operators?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, a collection of disjoint operators which make up the order one manifold.

**Thomas Eckert:** What is the order one manifold?

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's the question.

**Jerod Santo:** Order dash one? Order minus one? I don't know. Order one?

**Thomas Eckert:** I just haven't heard of that before. It's interesting. It could be that one... You know, I do think it's the statistical variabilities within multiple datasets that just kind of feels right to me... Hetero - you know, different, mixing together, and then -city describing the state... So I'll go with number five.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, Thomas gets five. We go to Matthew...

**Matthew Sanabria:** I'm also leaning five... I think that makes sense. I don't think the stable state one makes sense. I don't think the order one makes sense. What else was there? Shear resistance was one...

**Jerod Santo:** Fine-tuning...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Fine tuning of some data structure... And then what was that one I'm missing?

**Jerod Santo:** It was a material having differing shear resistances.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah, so I have shear, data structure, order manifold...

**Jerod Santo:** And stable configurations.

**Matthew Sanabria:** That's it?

**Jerod Santo:** And statistical property.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Damn, I think I'm with you on this one, Thomas... \[laughs\] I'm piling on.

**E. David Aja:** It worked out last time...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Please pile me on.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, sir.

**Thomas Eckert:** A stack-up around the normal distribution...

**Jerod Santo:** This is feeling like a repeat. Okay, David's out. Adam.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[24:13\] I'm going to pile on... I don't know what I'm piling onto, but whatever they chose, I'm choosing. That's it. \[laughter\]

**Thomas Eckert:** Blind faith...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Adam gets it.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah... He's just following along like a lemming...

**Adam Stacoviak:** I've learned, okay?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Well --

**Adam Stacoviak:** Follow or lead, and if you can't lead, you follow. I'm following, okay?

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Fair. Taylor, are you leading? Are you following? What are you doing?

**Taylor Troesh:** I'm leading.

**Thomas Eckert:** That's a warm pile, Taylor...

**Taylor Troesh:** My grandma always used to say, "Taylor, homoscedasticity is shear resistance in a single direction." So it must be the opposite, you know?

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Taylor Troesh:** Like, this is a family secret, and I just realized that this must be the truth.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Taylor, this was your grandmother who worked in the bomb factory, and she used to tell you stories about her time in the bomb factory to put you to sleep, and you can ask ChatGPT to --

**Taylor Troesh:** Exactly. That same grandma. Yeah.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah. That same grandma.

**Thomas Eckert:** He would snore just "Heteroscedasticity..." \[laughter\] When he goes to sleep.

**Jerod Santo:** You almost can't snore that. \[unintelligible 00:25:15.16\] Alright, so you're going with the material, huh? The differing shear resistances, because your grandma told you so?

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Just making sure. Alright. So we find ourselves in similar grounds as last round, except for David has the correct answer... And so David, why don't you tell everybody what the right answer is?

**E. David Aja:** I drew a little diagram, because I used to love trying to draw this when I wanted to be an economics professor... This is a homoscedastic distribution, where the normals are basically kind of the same... And then this is a heteroscedastic distribution, where the variance for one subgroup is smaller than the other.

**Thomas Eckert:** But they're both in danger from that T-Rex...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, the T-Rex is definitely after both distributions. So either way, you're going down.

**E. David Aja:** So you're getting eaten no matter what, but...

**Jerod Santo:** That's right.

**Taylor Troesh:** Was that a drawing of a metal pipe? Because it's materials, right? Was my grandma lying to me? \[laughter\]

**E. David Aja:** Your grandmother --

**Jerod Santo:** I can't see the different shears. Come on, that's not a drawing of the shear resistance. Alright, so Taylor's grandma led him right into Matthew's lap... Matthew wrote that one, so one point for Matthew. And the three of you all got it correct. "The statistical property in which some subpopulations in a collection of random variables have different variabilities from the others." Of course, hetero, everybody knows what that means... The last part, the skedasticity, comes from the ancient Greek word "skedonimi", which means to scatter. So there you have it.

**Taylor Troesh:** Oh, it also comes from skedaddle.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, which is when you've got to run. \[unintelligible 00:26:55.02\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right. They actually -- that's how they got that. They mispronounced skedasticity.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right. And if you want everybody to run in different directions, you say "Let's heteroskedaddle."

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right. All day. \[laughter\] Gosh...

**Jerod Santo:** Like cockroaches. "Heteroskedaddle...!" Okay, so three points for David. Matthew gets two plus one. He gets three. Thomas gets two, Adam gets two... Taylor - locked out of this round. After two rounds, we have David in first with six, Matthew with five, Thomas with four, Taylor with three, Adam on the board, with two... And I'm still sitting at zero. However, I'm very excited for round three, because the word for round three is... Achakatura.

**Break**: \[27:45\]

**Jerod Santo:** Acciaccatura.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Ooh, I like that one.

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, you heard that right... Acciaccatura. A-C-C-I-A-C-C-A-T-U-R-A. Please submit your definitions for acciaccatura now.

**Thomas Eckert:** Do we know if you're pronouncing that correctly?

**Jerod Santo:** That's the way the person on YouTube said it when I looked up how to pronounce that word. Now, they could have been wrong, because I did not go for multiple sources.

**Adam Stacoviak:** This is like a play on acai... That's what this is. This is like acai--ccatura. \[laughter\]

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah, just a few more letters on that one...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Right...?

**Thomas Eckert:** Just a few.

**Taylor Troesh:** The double CC's... That's a very rare thing.

**Jerod Santo:** Isn't it?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Very rare.

**Jerod Santo:** And what's weird is the first CC's are the cia, and the second CC's are the ca. Accia-ca.

**Taylor Troesh:** But there's no sss...

**Jerod Santo:** It sounds so weird that now I'm going to go -- you guys keep typing, I'm going to go double-check YouTube and maybe get a second source... Maybe I'm saying it wrong. No, yeah, I'm saying it right.

**Thomas Eckert:** Okay. I'll stop pressuring you.

**Jerod Santo:** Thank you. I was questioning a lot of things in my life, so... \[laughs\] Happily, I'm back on firm ground here.

**Thomas Eckert:** Country of origin... Use it in a sentence...

**Jerod Santo:** Uh, yes. The sentence is, "The word for round three is acciaccatura." \[laughter\] Yeah... It's not my first \#define, Thomas...

**Taylor Troesh:** I'd like to buy a vowel hint thing, whatever, and get Adam's LLM...

**Jerod Santo:** There's a lot of vowels in this word.

**Taylor Troesh:** I would like the LLM from Adam to be used...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\]

**Taylor Troesh:** How do we do that...? Here, I have dollar... How do I pay for that?

**Adam Stacoviak:** "I have dollar..."?

**Taylor Troesh:** I have dollar...

**Jerod Santo:** I think bribes might work...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Only one? Only one?

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah. How many tokens can I get?

**Jerod Santo:** "How many tokens can I get with this buck...?"

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right. It might cost a bit more than that.

**Thomas Eckert:** Taylor, did your grandma tell you anything about this word?

**Taylor Troesh:** Actually, yes... I'm very excited.

**Jerod Santo:** "I'm very excited..." \[laughs\] Well, she led you astray with the previous word, which I will not pronounce again.

**Taylor Troesh:** She's not perfect, and that's okay.

**Jerod Santo:** To her credit, she was not talking about hetero, she was talking about homo. So... It's an entirely different thing. Don't let me distract you guys... I know you're all working hard. Taylor's done, though.

**Taylor Troesh:** It's really easy when you cheat and you just look up the definition, you know? It makes things go a lot faster.

**Jerod Santo:** \[32:02\] That's what my grandma always said.

**Taylor Troesh:** Are there any words with the mythical triple C?

**Jerod Santo:** Like, in existence?

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah, dude... Three Cs...

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] That's a great question. I don't know the answer to that.

**Thomas Eckert:** Did you find anything?

**Jerod Santo:** Not yet.

**Thomas Eckert:** No? I don't think it exists.

**Jerod Santo:** Initial searches are not good.

**Thomas Eckert:** No.

**Jerod Santo:** Now I'm going to my second round of searching.

**Thomas Eckert:** CC is a cubic centimeter...

**Taylor Troesh:** Did you learn that in Canada?

**Thomas Eckert:** 20 CCs of this stack...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, yeah...

**Thomas Eckert:** But cubic centimeter is the same as a milliliter.

**Taylor Troesh:** What is that in American?

**Thomas Eckert:** In American?

**E. David Aja:** I was in a distillery once, and there's the equivalence between like a gram of water and a cubic -- a gram and a milliliter are the same amount.

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah..

**E. David Aja:** And then they said they measured their water in pounds, and I was just like "I don't trust whatever's going on back there..."

**Jerod Santo:** Is that British pounds, or...?

**E. David Aja:** I think... They are imperial pounds.

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] It's looking like there aren't any CCCs. You mean the Cs have to be next to each other, right? Yeah.

**Taylor Troesh:** You're talking about a word that has CC next to each other three times.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, is that what you want? I thought you wanted three Cs in a row.

**Taylor Troesh:** No, I wanted three Cs in a row.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, you did. So I'm giving you what you want and you can't have any. Thomas was trying to give you something different, which is two Cs, three times.

**Thomas Eckert:** Is there any word in the English language that has three of the same letter next to each other, of any letter?

**Jerod Santo:** I think like giggity, probably...

**Taylor Troesh:** Oh, that's a good one... When we were expecting our child, if we had a boy, I wanted to name him Aaron, with three A's... He'd be first in everything. \[laughter\]

**Thomas Eckert:** Elon Musk kid challenges...

**Jerod Santo:** That reminds me of the A--AaRon. That reminds me of that sketch.

**Thomas Eckert:** That's a good sketch...

**Taylor Troesh:** Can you start their name with a null terminator? Like, just terminate any string?

**Jerod Santo:** Or a semi-colon.

**Matthew Sanabria:** No, the... What's the Greek question mark? That looks like a semi-colon.

**Thomas Eckert:** Oh, awful.

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** It's called an awful?

**Thomas Eckert:** No, it's called \[unintelligible 00:34:37.23\] or whatever it is. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** That's the Greek question. That's the acciaccatura.

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah, exactly.

**Thomas Eckert:** Acacia cat...

**Jerod Santo:** Acacia... That's a bush. Alright, we have everybody's except... Who are we missing here? Oh, we've got them all.

**Thomas Eckert:** Adam's. It was Adam's.

**Jerod Santo:** He's in.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Finally, my LLM finally got back to me... It's like "Come on, man, you're taking way too long here." Oh, gosh...

**Thomas Eckert:** Use \[unintelligible 00:35:13.04\] or something, dude. What are you doing...?

**Jerod Santo:** Hey, nobody knows what this word means... That's a relief.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I went to this website called tooadvanced.com, and it was just... They have a brand new LLM there. It was just too advanced.

**Jerod Santo:** I appreciated how ChatGPT-5 tried to answer the three C's in a row... Because it would come up with words with two Cs, and then it would throw a third C in there and be like "Nope, that doesn't work..." \[laughs\] Like stucco. It's like, "Stucco has two Cs. Let me add a third C", and it's like "Nope, that's not the word stucco." \[laughs\] Oh, I was enjoying that back here. Okay...

**E. David Aja:** \[35:53\] The world's smartest five-year-old \[unintelligible 00:35:52.16\]

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. That's why it's GPT-5, it's for five years old. Okay... Six definitions of acciaccatura. Number one, a brief grace note played before a principal note, then immediately released. Number two, the order of operations for actions that must first precede other actions before being executed. Number three, a partial eclipse of a planet formed by multiple moons. Number four, a fungal infection affecting the forearms. Number five, a genus of fungi native to South American rainforests. And number six, when a material has a single plane of shear resistance... \[laughter\] I tried... I tried really hard. Okay... \[laughter\] Matthew, you are up first this round.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yes... Okay, so a single plane of shear resistance...

**Jerod Santo:** Yes.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Fungal arm...?

**Jerod Santo:** Fungal infection affecting the forearms.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Something else about a fungus?

**Jerod Santo:** A genus of fungi native to South American rainforests.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Uh-huh...

**Jerod Santo:** A partial eclipse...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Partial eclipse, pre-note, and order of operations sort of thing.

**Jerod Santo:** Order of operations, yeah.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Okay. I am honestly between two here. Can you repeat the definitions for the pre-note one and for the arm fungus?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, "A brief grace note played before a principal note, then immediately released", was the musical one. And then the fungus one was "A fungal infection affecting the forearms." Forearms. One word. Not four arms, like you have four --

**Matthew Sanabria:** What if you have two arms...? \[laughs\]

**Thomas Eckert:** You don't have to worry about the other one...

**Jerod Santo:** That's acciuccatura. No, I can't even come up with anything...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah, I think what's throwing me off about the fungus one is that it's specific to the forearm. \[laughter\]

**Thomas Eckert:** That's what's throwing you off about it...? \[laughter\]

**Matthew Sanabria:** It's like, why would that classify different? You know what I mean? Like, what if it was like on my bicep, or something? Why would that be different?

**Jerod Santo:** Are there fungi that only affect the forearms?

**E. David Aja:** Different fibers, man.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right, man.

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah, exactly.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's different parts of the arm. Get it right.

**Thomas Eckert:** How much you sweat, different parts of your body... Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** It's like when you do a lift, and you're like "This will only work my bicep", and it's \[unintelligible 00:38:13.27\]

**Matthew Sanabria:** I think I like the musical note one, personally... So I think I'm going to lock in the musical note.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, Matthew is on the music note. We go to David.

**E. David Aja:** What was the other fungus?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes, there was the fungal infection, which we've talked about extensively... And then there's "A genus of fungi native to South American rainforests."

**E. David Aja:** And one of these is the correct answer.

**Jerod Santo:** That's... That's right.

**Thomas Eckert:** Unless Jerod is playing -- unless he's just playing a trick on all of us.

**Jerod Santo:** This entire round is just a big troll... Like, "Surprise! It's not a real word."

**E. David Aja:** So we've got two funguses...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Fake word.

**E. David Aja:** Sorry, I'm going to do it. Can I have the final three one more time?

**Jerod Santo:** The final three? Wow. Well, if that's going to do it... Okay, so number four was the fungal infection affecting the forearms. Number five is the genus of fungi native to South American rainforest, and number six is when a material has a single plane of shear resistance.

**E. David Aja:** Alright, alright. That...

**Jerod Santo:** That's the one you forgot about...?

**E. David Aja:** Yeah, I just -- like, it just flew through me. It was so perceptive... I'm going to go for the musical term as well.

**Jerod Santo:** David's going for music.

**Taylor Troesh:** And he has the -- I see a bass in the background. He's a musician, so... That's very suspicious, that a musician might pick the musical one.

**E. David Aja:** I mean, I'm not a musician. I just own several instruments that I hide behind me.

**Jerod Santo:** He likes guitars.

**Thomas Eckert:** As he showcases more instruments, to further --

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Yeah, he moves so you can see the rest of his guitars. How many forearms do you have? Okay...

**E. David Aja:** I play all of them simultaneously.

**Jerod Santo:** Taylor, what are you thinking? You're going to pile on with these guys? Are you going to go fungal? Are you going to go somewhere else altogether? Shear resistance...?

**Taylor Troesh:** No, my grandma led me astray. I'm not falling prey to the shear resistance once again.

**Jerod Santo:** \[40:16\] He's resisting shear resistance.

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah, she actually -- my grandma told me that that acciaccatura is an eclipse... But I'm not trusting her, so I'm gonna go for the grace note and pile on.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, he's piling on on the grace note. Oh, boy... We go now to Thomas.

**Thomas Eckert:** Okay, so grace note has a pile-on... And the order of operation for actions doesn't have any love. Partial eclipse with multiple moons... That looks -- like, I'm trying to imagine what that would look like, and that would be pretty cool to see. But I don't see how that's acciaccatura.

**Taylor Troesh:** Have you seen Star Wars?

**Thomas Eckert:** Have I seen Star Wars? Yes.

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah, it's like that.

**Thomas Eckert:** That's multiple suns...?

**Taylor Troesh:** Dude, you didn't watch the end credit scene.

**Thomas Eckert:** The end credits is all multiple moons? \[laughs\] Yeah, moon fest...

**Jerod Santo:** It's not just multiple moons, it's a partial eclipse of multiple moons.

**Thomas Eckert:** It's a partial eclipse of multiple moons.

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Thomas Eckert:** Yes. A rare occurrence. We have fungal in the forearms... Like ringworm, different places... Rumble in the jungle, fungal in the forearms...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, fungal in the forearm.

**Thomas Eckert:** But there's some fungus feeling thing about acciaccatura, and I'm going to go with number five, the genus of fungi native to South America.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. So we have Thomas on the South American rainforest fungi.

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah, all alone on my little island.

**E. David Aja:** No man is an island... I don't remember the rest of the poem, but...

**Taylor Troesh:** That's a poem?

**Thomas Eckert:** It's a book... Well, it's a poem and it's a book.

**Jerod Santo:** It's a book by Thomas...

**Thomas Eckert:** It's just a crazy book.

**Jerod Santo:** This guy's pulling out books, man...

**Thomas Eckert:** That's what they are.

**Taylor Troesh:** Thomas reads, dude. He has a book that says "No man is an island."

**Jerod Santo:** He just book-checked you.

**Thomas Eckert:** You should read some Thomas Burton. That would be the plug...

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's awesome. I love that.

**Jerod Santo:** Adam, what are you thinking, man?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Mom always told me if I get a chance to pile on, to pile on... So I'm gonna pile on. \[laughter\] Listen to grandparents and mamas, okay?

**Jerod Santo:** He's just following the crowd here.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Mom always said if there's a good pile-on, pile on.

**Jerod Santo:** With the crowds. Alright, let's start right there... Acciaccatura is a brief grace note played before a principal note, then immediately released. I think it's an Italian word. So Matthew, David, Taylor and Adam each get two points. Matthew, David, Taylor, Adam. And Thomas guessed a genus of fungi native South American rainforest - that was Matthew, so he gets a bonus point.

**Thomas Eckert:** Oh, good job, Matthew. We both had fungus on the mind...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Oh, perfect. I was wondering who else did the fungus one.

**Jerod Santo:** I really liked a fungal infection affecting the forearms... However, it had this certain role to the sentence where I thought "That can't be a real thing, because it just sounds so--" "A fungal infection affecting the forearms..." It's almost alliterative. Like, it's poetic.

**Matthew Sanabria:** That's what got me with the water one last time. I was like "They said water twice."

**Thomas Eckert:** Which was mine.

**Jerod Santo:** That also Thomas's. He's on to you, dude...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Honestly, I've been reading too much... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Come down here with us plebs, you know...?

**Matthew Sanabria:** I did just see Hamlet... I saw Hamlet last week, and maybe that's all getting in my head.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, maybe it is. Did he have a forearm infection?

**Matthew Sanabria:** No, but it's Shakespeare. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Thanks. Now he's educating us plebs. He's like "That's Shakespeare, if you didn't know..." That's the only author that I know. Okay...

**Matthew Sanabria:** That's the only author you know... \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** \[44:04\] Yeah. Shakespeare, and... I don't know. Yup, that's it. I can't think of another one. Here we go...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Alright, alright.

**Jerod Santo:** Round four. Well, let's total up the points here... After three rounds, David and Matthew tied with eight. It's a battle, guys... Taylor with five, Thomas and Adam tied at four.

**Thomas Eckert:** And Jerod with...

**Jerod Santo:** And I'm still shut out. Well, you guys keep piling on, which usually helps me, because if you pile on the wrong answer, I win... But you're piling on to the right answer, and I lose.

**Thomas Eckert:** You invited us champions here...

**Jerod Santo:** It's true. I should expect the best, and you guys are giving it to me. Okay, round four - Give it a Goog. Oh, yes. This is our Give it a Goog round, in which I open up an Incognito tab and I don't change my IP address, so yes, you can go ahead and judge us Nebraskans... As I start to type a phrase into Google, and then I stop and let it autocomplete. I then write down the top autocomplete answer from google.com when an Incognito tab in Nebraska types "Steve Jobs", space. Steve Jobs, then I stopped... Then I got some suggestions. Your chore is to write down what you think a believable suggestion would be the top one, and send it to me whenever you're ready.

**Adam Stacoviak:** So just his name and then space?

**Jerod Santo:** That's right. His name, Steve, space, Jobs, space... What do you think Google would expect me to type next? Oh, these are coming in hot and heavy... \[laughs\] These are good... These are good.

**Taylor Troesh:** Just to clarify, would "Steve Jobs space needle" be a good answer?

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] You could try it, yeah.

**Taylor Troesh:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** I wouldn't stop you.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Is that a clarification?

**Jerod Santo:** I'm leaving the space up to...

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah, that one, too...

**Jerod Santo:** Thomas has a Steve Jobs book... I want you to -- your mission, should you choose to accept it, is every round you have to pick out a book that somehow relates, okay?

**Thomas Eckert:** \[laughs\] Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Somehow relates.

**Thomas Eckert:** That sounds exhausting.

**Jerod Santo:** It's a challenge.

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, it's gonna be tough if we get to round six, especially.

**Thomas Eckert:** Hmm... What's round six?

**Jerod Santo:** I'll tell you when we get there. Come on, no hints, no teasers... I guess that kind of was a teaser.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah, it was.

**Jerod Santo:** We're waiting for Adam and Taylor.

**Taylor Troesh:** I've gotta say, make files are very annoying sometimes... Just letting you all know.

**E. David Aja:** There's a heteroscedastic book... There you go.

**Thomas Eckert:** Hey, there you go... A little bit of tuft...

**Jerod Santo:** A little bit of tuft... Is that what --

**Thomas Eckert:** Is that not tuft?

**Jerod Santo:** No, that was my nickname back in college.

**Thomas Eckert:** \[unintelligible 00:47:09.28\] that book.

**E. David Aja:** I didn't know it's -- yeah, it's the visual display of quantitative information. Quant? Yeah, quant.

**Jerod Santo:** I sure pitched that... I pitched that round into your wheelhouse, didn't I, David? He's like "This word exists on the front page of a book that I've read... And I keep it nearby in case I need to reference it, or just show off to my friends." It's working. I think you're pretty cool at this point.

Okay. Everyone's in. Alright, so six potential autocompletes for the search "Steve jobs", blank. Steve Jobs - what. Google autocompletes, the top autocomplete. Here's your six potential answers. "Steve Jobs net worth", "Steve Jobs biography", "Steve Jobs feet pics..." \[laughter\]

**Taylor Troesh:** And that tells us all we need to know Nebraska...

**Jerod Santo:** "Steve Jobs daughter", "Steve Jobs wife", "Steve Jobs death." That's six. This round, the person who gets to go first is David.

**E. David Aja:** \[48:23\] These are largely depressingly plausible...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, exactly.

**E. David Aja:** I want to go net worth.

**Jerod Santo:** David goes net worth. Adam.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I've been curious by his feet, honestly... I've been thinking like "What does his feet look like?" \[laughter\] You know? I've seen him... Show me your feet, dude... Okay? Steve Jobs feet.

**Taylor Troesh:** He did famously walk around barefoot a lot.

**Adam Stacoviak:** You know, maybe he's got some ganglies, you know? Maybe it's well manicured.

**Jerod Santo:** Or a little bit of tuft.

**Thomas Eckert:** A little bit of tuft... \[laughter\] A little bit of fungus?

**Adam Stacoviak:** He could probably use some --

**Thomas Eckert:** A little bit of acciaccatura?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, I was trying to say that word.

**E. David Aja:** Some \[unintelligible 00:49:09.17\]

**Thomas Eckert:** Acciaccatura?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Acciaccatura on them feet, man... He needs some acciaccatura.

**Jerod Santo:** So you're going to go with feet pics, or...?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Heck no, man... \[laughter\] Who cares about that man's feet...? They want to know how much money he's got. Show me the money.

**Jerod Santo:** Show me the money. Alright, Steve Jobs net worth. Next up is Taylor.

**Taylor Troesh:** Oh, it's for sure the space needle. \[laughter\]

**Matthew Sanabria:** It wasn't any of them.

**Taylor Troesh:** Steve Jobs space needle.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's definitely space needle, okay?

**Taylor Troesh:** Okay, I'll go daughter then.

**Jerod Santo:** I appreciate you doubling down on that joke. Daughter?

**Taylor Troesh:** No, it was a good bit. I had to... Yeah, daughter.

**Jerod Santo:** It was a good one. Taylor's going for Steve Jobs daughter. Okay... Thomas.

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah. Net worth... Biography... Feet pics... Daughter, wife and death.

**Jerod Santo:** That's right.

**Thomas Eckert:** Gotta end with death, as always... So daughter - she came up with a book, "Small Fry", a couple of years ago...

**Jerod Santo:** Really?

**Thomas Eckert:** Oh, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** About fast food, or...? McDonald's?

**Thomas Eckert:** No.

**Jerod Santo:** Is she a small human? I don't understand Small Fry. What's the context?

**Thomas Eckert:** I don't actually know what the context is of the title...

**Adam Stacoviak:** It was his pinky toe. Dad's pinky toe.

**Thomas Eckert:** It's that that's what it was. And you would only know that if you looked up the feet pics, as everyone else in Nebraska has.

**Jerod Santo:** Was it a picture book?

**Thomas Eckert:** It's not a picture book. It's a very serious book, about...

**Adam Stacoviak:** It was actually the invention dad never did. That's what it was.

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah. He never invented the small fry.

**Jerod Santo:** Do you have it on your shelf behind you?

**Thomas Eckert:** No, I don't, actually, but I do want to read it. It's on my list of books I want to read. I've got too much stuff going on.

Alright... We've got daughter, or wife... You know, I'm going to go with daughter, because she wrote the book... I wonder if people are like "Steve jobs daughter who wrote the book", but they don't remember her name. Because she didn't -- she was Lisa Brennan for a while, before... Now she goes by Lisa Brennan Jobs.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so you're going with daughter.

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, Thomas says daughter, along with Taylor... David and Adam are on net worth, and Matthew is the only one who hasn't picked yet. What are you thinking, man?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Um, what is it, net worth, daughter...?

**Jerod Santo:** Wife...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Wife or life?

**Jerod Santo:** Wife.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Wife.

**Jerod Santo:** Biography...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Biography.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Life. Is it life?

**Jerod Santo:** It was wife.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Net worth, for sure.

**Jerod Santo:** You're going net worth.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah, I'm piling.

**Jerod Santo:** He's piling.

**Jerod Santo:** We have two piles here. We have two piles, but which one is right? David, Adam, and Matthew chose net worth. Steve Jobs net worth. Are people Google searching that? I don't know, but Adam created it, so he should know...

**Taylor Troesh:** Nice.

**Jerod Santo:** \[52:14\] Good job, Adam. You get one point for David and Matthew. You don't score any points for guessing your own, but you did convince people.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh yeah, I forgot I guessed my own. \[laughs\] Whoops...

**Thomas Eckert:** No, you have to pretend like that's a strategy.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I really just did forget. I was like "It's gotta be net worth." \[laughs\]

**Thomas Eckert:** Play if off. Play it off...

**Jerod Santo:** Well, fun fact - net worth was actually the third autocomplete for me. So it was right up there at the top. The second autocomplete for me was death, so that was right there at the top. Matthew actually said death. But the number one autocomplete for Steve Jobs is "Steve Jobs daughter." So Taylor and Thomas landed on it.

**Taylor Troesh:** Taylor Thomas. Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

**Jerod Santo:** Two points each for JTT... And I get zero, so I guess J doesn't get any, but TT gets two... Other autocompletes there in that list: death, net worth, children, cause of death, wife... And finally, Steve Job quotes. Ah... No feet pics. No whatsoever. That was Thomas's. He threw a wrench, and it was a good one.

Alright, so after round four, we still have Matthew and David tied, with eight. That makes sense. Did you guys score that round? No, you did not. Just making sure my calculator is working... Matthew and David have eight. Taylor has seven. Thomas has six. Adam has six... This is a very tight game of \#define. We move now to round five.

**Break**: \[53:44\]

**Jerod Santo:** We're moving on to round five, where we play a round of "Weird flicks, but okay..." In this round, I have gone out to the interwebs and I have found an obscure old movie...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, yes.

**Jerod Santo:** In fact, I've found a movie from 1928. I then took the synopsis of that movie - you know, the one-liner description of what the movie's about. You can read it on IMDb, etc... And I jotted that down. Your job is to write a synopsis given the name and the year that it was made, and convince all of us that you actually wrote the real synopsis of the movie. The movie I wrote down is called The Man Who Laughs. The Man Who Laughs. It's from 1928. Please submit to me your synopses for The Man Who Laughs whenever you have them ready.

**E. David Aja:** And we're confident on that year this time?

**Jerod Santo:** The year is correct. The year is correct.

**Thomas Eckert:** I've gotta go over to my DVD shelf to grab it.

**Taylor Troesh:** Just for Thomas, a movie is like a book, but a fun book. It's like a fun version of a book.

**Thomas Eckert:** A fun book... A fun... Book... Okay.

**Matthew Sanabria:** And it takes like several hours to days to finish?

**Taylor Troesh:** Oh, if you're doing at one speed, dude. If you're a rookie.

**Matthew Sanabria:** You've gotta watch all my movies at 2x speed... \[laughs\]

**Taylor Troesh:** Just as Scorsese intended. You've gotta watch it on your iPod Nano at double speed, you know?

**Thomas Eckert:** Have you seen Star Wars...?

**Matthew Sanabria:** That should be the legal question...

**Jerod Santo:** That reminds me, did you guys hear Ira Glass came out, of NPR fame, of This American Life - came out and said "All podcasts should be listened to at 2x"? It surprised me.

**E. David Aja:** He did not say that...

**Jerod Santo:** He did say that.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Who said this?

**Jerod Santo:** Ira Glass. Says podcasts should be listened to, including his own - all podcasts - 2x.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm gonna start speaking really slow then. And all my jokes are gonna take way too long. Speed that up, 2xers, tell me how that sounds.

**Taylor Troesh:** Adam, all your jokes already take too long.

**Thomas Eckert:** I normally speak fast, so people generally slow me down.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. I've got too much excitement, and I'm Texan, so when I speak, it's just Texan... I don't know how to say it, okay?

**Thomas Eckert:** I don't know what that means. Is it big words?

**Taylor Troesh:** Did you learn your first big word, Adam?

**Jerod Santo:** Acciaccatura.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Star! That's all we know how to say here in Texas. Star.

**Jerod Santo:** Matthew, just in case you didn't know, you just gave me the title...

**Matthew Sanabria:** I know, I know, I sent you the title back. I like to give you the word, and the thing that we're doing...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, I forgot I'm supposed to be describing a movie here. I'm talking.

**Matthew Sanabria:** And I hit Enter to do a new line.

**Adam Stacoviak:** The Man Who Laughs, is that what this is?

**Jerod Santo:** The Man Who Laughs. 1928.

**Adam Stacoviak:** The Man Who Laughs. Okay. I can do this.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Jerod, when do you get the first snow in Nebraska?

**Jerod Santo:** Well, we have very unpredictable weather, so it can be as early as Halloween... And we had actually one year a humongous snowstorm on Halloween. Closed it down. But more realistically, it's like late December or early January. But it's cold far before it snows, so... It'll be getting cold here soon. Right now it's perfect weather. We're in like 60s, 50s. Sunny. I like when the sun is hot, but the air is cold.

**Matthew Sanabria:** \[01:00:05.24\] That's good weather. Well, then you're in the right place.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Thomas Eckert:** I will say, Adam, I take your criticism of the Canadian American experience, but one of the big benefits is two Thanksgivings.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Thomas Eckert:** I've already had a Thanksgiving. It was great. I've got another Thanksgiving coming up in a few weeks...

**Jerod Santo:** It's gonna be great.

**Thomas Eckert:** Thanksgiving really should happen twice a year.

**Taylor Troesh:** Totally agree. 10 out of 10.

**Jerod Santo:** It's actually like my favorite thing.

**Thomas Eckert:** And they're spaced out enough, right? They're about a month and change apart, so that that second one really comes and you're like "Oh, yeah, I love Thanksgiving. It's great. It's coming around again."

**Jerod Santo:** Is it similar fare, or is there other...?

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah, similar fare, same stuff, just different day.

**Jerod Santo:** Cool.

**Thomas Eckert:** I did the turkey this year... Though I got too big of a turkey for the number of people we had.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, that just means you've got turkey sandwiches.

**Thomas Eckert:** Turkey sandwiches... I made some stock...

**E. David Aja:** What's your preferred preparation for the turkey?

**Thomas Eckert:** I do a salt rub the night before, and let it air dry in the refrigerator. So I leave it uncovered. It gets the skin nice and crispy. And then day of, melt butter over it, chop up a lot of veggies, put them in the bottom of the pan, and roast it. I don't do anything too crazy fancy, and it just comes out perfectly.

**Jerod Santo:** It sounds alarmingly like some sort of treatment for fungus, foreign fungus...

**Adam Stacoviak:** What is this you're making here? Are these your potatoes?

**Thomas Eckert:** No. Turkey. Have you ever deep-fried turkey?

**E. David Aja:** I don't have a house to set on fire, so...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Totally did.

**Thomas Eckert:** So the only time I've ever done it was with my uncle, who is a career firefighter. And that was the only person with whom I felt safe enough to deep-fry a turkey.

**E. David Aja:** I appreciate, all the local fire departments doing the video where they drop a turkey that's not quite frozen - or not quite thawed - and you just watch it...

**Thomas Eckert:** Not quite thawed, yeah. Any of that water, it just goes \[unintelligible 01:02:33.21\] Matthew, how's your wife's chocolate business?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Great. I actually have to take pictures for the next Thanksgiving Christmas collection tomorrow, I think.

**Thomas Eckert:** Does she ship to Canada?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Not to Canada, because the border crossing will get you...

**Thomas Eckert:** I know, it's so expensive... I know, it's fine. That's fine, that's fine.

**Matthew Sanabria:** But if you can meet us at Niagara Falls...

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah, just meet you at the border...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, there you go.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah, "Why are you coming down today? A little chocolate --"

**Thomas Eckert:** A little chocolate swap. Just toss it across the border... \[laughter\]

**Taylor Troesh:** Oh, that's called smuggling.

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah. There's nothing wrong with that.

**Jerod Santo:** I prefer snuggling.

**Thomas Eckert:** Chocolate \[unintelligible 01:03:15.06\] What's the difference? I mean, come on...

**Jerod Santo:** I was watching a video about the engineering of Niagara Falls the other day, really interesting stuff... And what I learned was that pretty much the exact same setup is replicated on both sides. And it was kind of like a peeing contest, to a certain degree. It's like "You're going to do that? We're going to do it." Like, they couldn't share. They couldn't work together. It was like "No, we're both going to have the exact same deal. We're just going to do everything twice." Oh, that was kind of funny... I think they worked together in a certain sense, of like the design, because everything's designed like mirrored, to a certain degree, which is kind of cool... But I didn't know there was like all that going on back then.

\[01:04:00.04\] Six pretty well-written synopses for 1928's The Man Who Laughs... But which one is the actual movie plot? Here we go.

Number one, "The Man Who Laughs recounts the story of Dr. Dennis Rockwell, who struggles with his grip on reality as he treats his patients out at Mount Basker Mental Asylum." Number two, "A disgruntled railroad worker catches the next train out of town to find beauty in life." Number three, "A veteran of the Great War cheerfully tries to save his farm." Number four, "A disfigured nobleman with a permanent grin is forced into circus life and separated from his true identity." Number five, "Darkly romantic, a comedian is heartbroken when his lover leaves him for a member of his audience, the man who laughs." And number six, "Thrust into the starlight, two laugh-filled men adventure together to seek the love of the same woman. As stage performers who travel, they find it hard to see her in the crowd, so they developed a laugh from bellows down below to win her love." Alright, six different potential synopses of 1928's The Man Who Laughs. Adam, you can't pile on this round, because you are first.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Gosh... Is there any way to go last? Is that possible? \[laughter\]

**Taylor Troesh:** You can't pile on, because you're first. "Can I just not do that...?" \[laughs\]

**E. David Aja:** I do think that would be an interesting mechanic to introduce in a future version of this game...

**Jerod Santo:** Adam always goes last?

**E. David Aja:** Or just like someone gets the ability to...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, to like play that card every once in a while, or something. Yeah, that's a good idea. Interesting.

**Adam Stacoviak:** You know, I wasn't listening, so... \[laughter\] I'm used to going last... Can I get to pile on, push my button that's just a -- you know, the easy button... Could I ask you to describe them to me again?

**Jerod Santo:** I'm going to give you briefs, because this is a lot of reading.

**Adam Stacoviak:** No, you can just give me the summary.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, so number one was the story of Dr. Dennis Rockwell...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Okay, yeah. I remember that. I was listening to that one, I was kidding.

**Jerod Santo:** ...at the Mt. Basker Mental Asylum. Number two --

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's a pretty good one, whoever wrote that.

**Jerod Santo:** Number two was the disgruntled railroad worker who catches the next train out of town.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, yeah, also pretty good.

**Jerod Santo:** And he finds beauty in life. Yeah. Number three was the veteran of the Great War who cheerfully tries to save his farm.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, that's a good one, too.

**Jerod Santo:** Number four, a disfigured nobleman with a permanent grin, who's forced into circus life.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That does have smile feels...

**Jerod Santo:** What?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, you said "laughs", so I guess - laugh, smile... It's all the same, right?

**Jerod Santo:** Number five was a comedian who is heartbroken when his lover leaves him for a member of his audience. The man who laughs.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Taylor wrote that.

**Jerod Santo:** Wow. Call-out. Number six was the two laughed-filled men who are seeking the same woman's love. So there's your synopses of the synopses. What are you thinking? What are you convinced by? What are you...

**Adam Stacoviak:** You know, I just want to ask if I can go last. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** You can't. You can't go last.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Alright, fine, I will go with the disgruntled railroad worker who found a way to go down the mountain.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Who's that guy? Is that mixing them? Did I mix them?

**Jerod Santo:** A disgruntled railroad worker catches the next train out of town? That's one you want?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I don't know if I like that one...

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Well, we'll see -- Taylor, you're next.

**Adam Stacoviak:** What was the one before that?

**Thomas Eckert:** Can I go last...?

**Adam Stacoviak:** What was the one before that?

**Jerod Santo:** The man who goes last. Are you not locked in?

**Adam Stacoviak:** No... I'm still thinking about them...

**Jerod Santo:** Shoot... I thought we were moving on. Before that was the Dr. Dennis Rockwell at the mental asylum. He treats his patients, but he struggles when he loses a grip on reality.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[01:08:18.06\] Yeah, that's plausible for sure.

**Jerod Santo:** You want that one?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Nah... Railroad. I'll just go railroad. All day.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, you're sticking with railroad. Taylor, what do you want?

**Taylor Troesh:** Let's see... My grandma actually saw this one in theaters... \[laughter\]

**E. David Aja:** Did you say theaters?

**Taylor Troesh:** 1928, right? Yeah, at the cinema.

**Jerod Santo:** 1928. Yeah. At the cinema?

**Taylor Troesh:** She told me though it was the one about the old guy with the house, with the balloons... So that one's not an option. I'll go with the nobleman. The disfigured face.

**Jerod Santo:** The disfigured nobleman. Alright.

**Taylor Troesh:** Oh, wait. What was the first one again?

**Jerod Santo:** The Mount Basker Mental Asylum.

**Taylor Troesh:** Ooh...

**Jerod Santo:** You want that one instead?

**Taylor Troesh:** No, let's do nobleman.

**Jerod Santo:** Thomas.

**Thomas Eckert:** Let's see... So we have the mental asylum, we have beauty... Let's see. Man after the great war... Circus life, the comedian, and then the two laugh filled men. I feel like -- we have two laugh filled men. We call it "The men who laugh", or maybe that's the sequel. I'm going to go with the mental asylum one. The number one.

**Jerod Santo:** Number one.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's a good choice. That's a good choice.

**Thomas Eckert:** Is it yours?

**Adam Stacoviak:** No. Just good choice, man.

**Thomas Eckert:** \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** We'll go to Matthew.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Mental asylum one, railroad something, nobleman something...

**Taylor Troesh:** You should go with the one with the great war in it.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Something about a great war...

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah, because I don't think it happened yet... \[laughs\] 1921...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Can you read the --

**Jerod Santo:** It depends on which one you like, you know?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Can you read the asylum one and the nobleman one?

**Jerod Santo:** Sure.

**Matthew Sanabria:** They're not the same, right?

**Jerod Santo:** No, they're not the same. The asylum one is the story of Dr. Dennis Rockwell, who struggles with his grip on reality as he treats his patients at Mount Basker Mental Asylum.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Got it. Okay.

**E. David Aja:** Are you saying the great war wouldn't have happened by '28?

**Jerod Santo:** What's the great war? Is that World War I?

**Taylor Troesh:** 1928... No, you're right. But 1928 -- see, he just said doctors. They didn't have doctors in 1928. That one's false too, dude... \[laughter\]

**Matthew Sanabria:** Also synopsis is -- synopses whatever...

**Jerod Santo:** Yes?

**Matthew Sanabria:** You introduced me with too many characters in that synopses.

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Matthew Sanabria:** And the other one was the noble, something?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, disfigured nobleman.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Disfigured nobleman.

**Jerod Santo:** He's got a permanent grin.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Oh, like the Joker.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Always smiling.

**Jerod Santo:** He's forced in the circus life. \[laughs\] And separated from his true identity.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Oh, that sounds fun. So he's forced into it. Okay... I think I'm leaning into that one. Someone already picked that one though, right?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. Taylor picked that one, and Thomas picked the mental asylum one. So they both have one person on them.

**Matthew Sanabria:** I think I'm leaning towards the nobleman. The Joker story. The Joker origin story.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. You're going to lock that in?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Railroad is another one... Lovers something...

**Jerod Santo:** Yes...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah, I think the nobleman sounds the best here. It feels...

**Jerod Santo:** I don't think anyone here is going to use the word disfigured.

**Jerod Santo:** Wow. That's a dis.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, I'm going to lock you in then.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Lock me in, please.

**Jerod Santo:** Locked you in on the pile-on. We go to David.

**E. David Aja:** Yeah, I think my intuition last time was sort of prudish about what would be acceptable movie contents... And so the disfigured nobleman kind of sounds right to me as well, so... It's a pile-on, again.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, alright.

**E. David Aja:** We're a very conservative bunch here. We're all -- a lot of herding.

**Jerod Santo:** Seriously.

**Thomas Eckert:** I am in pain... So yeah, the hurting is real. No, I'm just kidding.

**Jerod Santo:** \[01:11:54.00\] Well, it's keeping the game close, because every time someone scores, everybody else scores also. Alright. Well, we've heard these synopses over and over and over again... Let's go to the guesses. Adam thought maybe it was the disgruntled railroad worker. That was written by Matthew, so one point to Matthew. Thomas was convinced by the Mount Basker mental asylum. I thought that one was amazing. Taylor wrote that. Good job, Taylor. A point to Taylor. And then the pile-on. They're piling onto a disfigured nobleman with a permanent grin, who's forced into circus life and separated from his true identity, in 1928's "The Man Who Laughs." That is the actual synopsis of a movie. It doesn't sound half bad, does it?

**Thomas Eckert:** It actually doesn't.

**Jerod Santo:** We'll have to go watch that movie, Thomas...

**Thomas Eckert:** Changelog movie night...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, or if you could get it converted into a book, then you could read it...

**Thomas Eckert:** I don't have to read everything as a book... \[laughter\] I also watch movies.

**Jerod Santo:** Then you can pull the book out when we talk about it.

**Taylor Troesh:** Fun fact - Man Who Laughs was the very first Pixar film.

**Jerod Santo:** This is coming from the guy who's calling into question the years of the Great War. That was David's, that's why he was defending that one.

**E. David Aja:** I tried to let it breathe for an appropriate amount of time...
**Jerod Santo:** You didn't want to jump to its defense too harshly, yeah... I knew what you were doing there, David. I could see it. Well played. Alright, so Taylor, Matthew, and David all get two points for getting that right... So three total points for Taylor, two for David, three for Matthew.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Where's my points? Did I get any points?

**Jerod Santo:** No, not this round. Unfortunately you didn't get to go last.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, man...

**Jerod Santo:** And that brings us to the end of round five, and Matthew is in striking distance - he has 11. Of course, Taylor and David are also in striking distance with 10. Thomas and Adam have six... And we don't have to talk about me.

**E. David Aja:** I'm going to call a two-point win \[unintelligible 01:13:46.25\]

**Taylor Troesh:** I don't know, man... I mean, I see the time... I've got to eat, bro...

**Thomas Eckert:** I'm not winning, so...

**Jerod Santo:** So your entire idea is you should switch to subterfuge, don't you think? That's your strategy?

**Thomas Eckert:** I'm just going to start reading.

**Jerod Santo:** Just start reading. \[laughter\] Alright, that brings us to round six, and that brings us to a very long word... Pronounced brobdingnagian. Brobdingnagian. The word for round six is brobdingnagian. And it's spelled B-R-O-B-D-I-N-G-N-A-G-I-A-N. Brobdingnagian. I think that's my best pronunciation yet. Brobdingnagian.

**Matthew Sanabria:** That is definitely not how it's pronounced... But I see why you're doing it that way.

**Jerod Santo:** This is the second time you've done this to me, and I'm telling you, I looked it up on YouTube, it's pronounced brobdingnagian.

**Adam Stacoviak:** So take that, Matthew...

**Jerod Santo:** Take that, Matthew...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. Check out your own YouTube videos for pronunciation, and step back --

**Jerod Santo:** You're rocking my world, again...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Brobdingnagian...

**Taylor Troesh:** If it ends in I-A-N, it's Armenian. So... Fun fact.

**Jerod Santo:** A slight alteration, it could also be pronounced brobdingnagian. So it could be nagian or nagian. I've heard them both now. But brobding is correct. Please submit to me your definitions of brobdingnagian. Or nagian, if you prefer... Now.

**Taylor Troesh:** You know what? It's been real... I'm going to get some dinner. \[laughter\] Jerod can't pronounce the words anymore.

**Jerod Santo:** Hey, I'm two for two, man. I'm two for two.

**Taylor Troesh:** Nah, you're good. You're good. This...

**Jerod Santo:** This word is interesting.

**Taylor Troesh:** I have words about this word...

**Jerod Santo:** Write them down and submit them to me.

**Taylor Troesh:** ...that I can't say it until our definitions are out there.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. Oh, by the way, Adam, did you LLM that last one?

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[01:16:01.19\] I haven't LLM'ed anything, man...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I can do that?

**Thomas Eckert:** You'd better start LLM-ing, buddy...

**Jerod Santo:** You're running out of time, dude...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Am I allowed to do that?

**Thomas Eckert:** You get one. You get one pass.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh my gosh, I should do this soon.

**Matthew Sanabria:** So I mute myself when I'm typing, because I have this gnarly clickety clacker... And when I do type, I get the little notification, "Hey, are you trying to speak? If you're trying to speak, you're muted right now." I'm not. I'm typing.

**Jerod Santo:** I prefer just to hear the clickety clacks, man...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Alright...

**Jerod Santo:** Let's get them.

**Matthew Sanabria:** But I have to do some thinking before it.

**Jerod Santo:** Now I know when you're not typing, too. And we silently judge you.

**Matthew Sanabria:** I think if you were really paying attention, you could notice how long was I typing, you could guess which...

**Jerod Santo:** I wouldn't put it past David. I think he's playing to win. He's probably going to listen to your typing and figure out your definition.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah... He has those big over-ear headphones on to really get --

**E. David Aja:** Matthew also has headphones...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Literally --

**E. David Aja:** The majority of people in this chat have --

**Matthew Sanabria:** I know, I know, I know, I know, I know. It's not lost on me.

**Thomas Eckert:** I mean, mine are open back, so I still hear the...

**E. David Aja:** Oh, okay. Yeah.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Oh, wow...

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah. I've got to hear my dog's barking, or my wife is calling me.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yup. I hear my dog barking. I'm going to take her for a walk.

**Taylor Troesh:** Can I change my answer for the Steve Jobs one? \[laughter\] I don't know... I just wondered if I could. If it's allowed.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, man. Go for it.

**Taylor Troesh:** Okay. I want to choose Steve Jobs net worth.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Hah!

**Jerod Santo:** That gives Adam another point.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, I know, right? Here we go.

**Matthew Sanabria:** I did get - this is relevant to Changelog. I did get this book before it came out...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, wow.

**Matthew Sanabria:** I got the not-for-resale...

**Thomas Eckert:** Before it came out?

**Jerod Santo:** Dang, dude...

**Taylor Troesh:** That's a contradiction, dude. You can't get something before it comes out.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Well, that's not true if you know the right people.

**Jerod Santo:** I had it before he wrote it, so...

**Matthew Sanabria:** You had it before he wrote it?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah... Well, you've got to know the right people.

**Matthew Sanabria:** No, this is -- it says "These proofs are not to be quoted for publication."

**Thomas Eckert:** You just published it, dude. You're on a podcast.

**Matthew Sanabria:** The book's out. The book came out. It says on the back when the book actually comes out... And it already came out. Everyone can buy it now.

**Thomas Eckert:** Did you hear about the sequel to that book called Constipation? No, you haven't. It hasn't come out yet. \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** That's a good one.

**E. David Aja:** Bravo. I hate that I love that, but that's a pretty good one.

**Jerod Santo:** He hates that loves it.

**Thomas Eckert:** That's a good one.

**Jerod Santo:** Such is life. Okay... Six definitions for brobdingnagian. Number one, purposefully accelerating civilization collapse. Number two, having to do with the sport of brobsledding. \[laughter\] Number three, a fictional area in the Golden Sun video game where the characters face the toughest enemies. Number four, a matrix of fourth derivatives. Number five, "Cousin to the Backyardigans. Malik, Zara, Kenji, and Luna love to play in the front yard..." \[laughter\]

**Thomas Eckert:** \[01:19:52.24\] You're not helping anything with that...

**Jerod Santo:** "...and imagine themselves on fantastic adventures."

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's awesome.

**Jerod Santo:** That's amazing. And number five -- or sorry, number six... "Marked by tremendous size." Marked by tremendous size. Okay. Six definitions... Good news for you, Adam - you get to go last. So you're safe. Taylor has to go first this round... Taylor, what do you think is brobdingnagian?

**Taylor Troesh:** I do just want to give a shout out real quick to the Backyardigans... I've been watching that show with my daughter, and it's got some fire tracks. Like...
**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, yeah, man...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, yeah?

**E. David Aja:** Kbrob demon hunters...

**Taylor Troesh:** Ooh... that's a good one. So it's between brobsledding - that was a very good one. Whoever did that, that's very clever. Brobsledding...

**E. David Aja:** It could be the real answer, you don't know... \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** You guys act like brobsledding is not real, or something...

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah, I think I like the first one and the last one. Those sounded the most legit.

**E. David Aja:** Yeah, they did.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Taylor Troesh:** The last one was size...?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, tremendous size.

**Taylor Troesh:** Tremendous size. No, that's too on the nose. What was the first one?

**Jerod Santo:** The first one was "Purposefully accelerating civilizational collapse."

**Taylor Troesh:** Ooh... Nah, that's too smart for me. What about... Let's pick the last one. Size.

**Jerod Santo:** Size. He's going for size. Size does matter for Taylor Thomas.

**Thomas Eckert:** Size... Size? Big? Or sighs... Which size? Marked by tremendous size.

**Taylor Troesh:** He's asking about a homonym.

**Jerod Santo:** What'd you call me? \[laughter\] S-I-Z-E. It's spelled S-I-Z-E.

**Thomas Eckert:** S-I-Z-E. Civilization -- so accelerating civilization collapse...

**Jerod Santo:** Correct.

**Thomas Eckert:** Brobsledding, which...

**Jerod Santo:** Brobsledding.

**Thomas Eckert:** I mean, it sounds really good...

**Jerod Santo:** And you have the Golden Sun video game.

**Thomas Eckert:** The Golden Sun video game... A Matrix of fourth derivatives?

**Jerod Santo:** Yes.

**Thomas Eckert:** The Backyardigans...

**Jerod Santo:** Cousin to the Backyardigans.

**Thomas Eckert:** Cousin to the Backyardigans, yeah. Marked by tremendous size. It's dark, but I'll do the acceleration of civilization collapse.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. We go to Matthew.

**Matthew Sanabria:** The summary of each of them was... Let me think if I remember this. Marked by tremendous size, one. Thomas'es collapse of civilization that he just picked...

**Jerod Santo:** Right. Brobsledding...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Brobsledding... Backyardigans, or something?

**Jerod Santo:** Correct.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Golden sun something...

**Jerod Santo:** Yes. And a matrix of fourth derivatives.

**Matthew Sanabria:** A matrix of fourth derivatives.

**Jerod Santo:** Correct.

**Matthew Sanabria:** As in math, I guess?

**Thomas Eckert:** No, these are programming languages that derive from fourth.

**Taylor Troesh:** Boo...

**Jerod Santo:** That's a homonym.

**Matthew Sanabria:** That is a homonym. Wow... I'm actually not sure. Brob --

**Jerod Santo:** Brobdingnagian.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Brobdingnagian. It sounds like a thing, rather than like a status, or like a description of something. It sounds like an actual thing.

**Jerod Santo:** Like a noun.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah, exactly.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Like it's a name... That's somebody hanging out.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah, it's like the name of a location, or something. Or it's a name of something. Like, you call someone this. You know what I mean?

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Like, you are such a thing.

**Jerod Santo:** Like it's a slur.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Okay, so I have to eliminate... Not the backyardigan thing, not the other brobsledding one... Collapsing of society, I don't think so. And then there's three more.

**Jerod Santo:** Marked by tremendous size, that's an adjective. And then you have the matrix of fourth derivatives, which would be a noun.

**Matthew Sanabria:** So I've narrowed down to what? Golden sun and size?

**Jerod Santo:** Golden sun and size. Well, size is not -- I'm not going to help you. I'm saying, it's not a noun. You were leaning on nouns.

**Matthew Sanabria:** \[01:24:17.29\] Agreed, but like every other ones... I don't like the other ones.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, fine. Whatever one you want.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Can you read the Golden Sun one, please? Can you read both of them?

**Jerod Santo:** A fictional area in the Golden Sun video game where the characters face the toughest enemies. And then "Marked by tremendous size."

**Matthew Sanabria:** Fictional area in Golden Sun.

**Thomas Eckert:** I like that it clarifies that it is a fictional area in the video game.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Like there's real areas and then there's fictional areas?

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah. Like, Grand Theft Auto is like real areas in a fictional game, you know?

**Jerod Santo:** Right. Or Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, like, you're on Burnside, but you're not actually there.

**Taylor Troesh:** By the way, Thomas, a video game is just a really fun movie. \[laughter\]

**Thomas Eckert:** A really fun movie... Hm...

**Jerod Santo:** It's a choose your own adventure book.

**Thomas Eckert:** I feel like there's an escalation of fun that I'm just missing out on.

**Matthew Sanabria:** I think I kind of have to pile on here, because... Yeah, nothing really names a video game. Like, why would a definition name something? I don't know.

**E. David Aja:** I mean, like Metaverse?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah, I guess... Alright, I'll pile on to the size one, because I don't believe it's a society collapse.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Matthew is with Taylor on size. David.

**Thomas Eckert:** You are a brobdignigan. You are so brobdignigan. \[laughs\] I don't know...

**E. David Aja:** Yeah. So brobdignagian... I don't know if there's like a word, like Manichaean, which is like a way that people construct a worldview that's kind of binary between good and evil... And so that's one way in which that could be related. There are -- my linear algebra is very rusty... So I feel like there are some named matrices, but I don't remember if that's one of them. We have a couple of obviously ridiculous ones... Sorry, did it specify what video game?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, Golden Sun.

**E. David Aja:** Golden Sun. Is that a popular game?

**Jerod Santo:** I haven't heard of it myself.

**E. David Aja:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** But I'm not a gamer very much. I just play Rocket League.

**E. David Aja:** Yeah. And then there's enormous size... It is kind of a big feeling word, you know?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**E. David Aja:** And thus, regrettably...

**Jerod Santo:** He's piling on.

**E. David Aja:** It's happening. It's happening. I'm not quite convinced by any of the others.

**Jerod Santo:** So Matthew and Taylor are tied with 11, and you have -- sorry. Matthew has 11. You and Taylor are tied with 10. And so all you are picking the same one.

**E. David Aja:** Yeah. No, I mean, I don't think there's a strategically better move to make than attempting to pick the correct thing. It's basically like going to -- yeah, let's see what happens.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, let's see what happens. Adam, you're up, man...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, my gosh... I'm going to have to have you read them all again for me, if you don't mind.

**Jerod Santo:** You can just pile on, dude... You're going last.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I don't want to go last, though, this time. I want to go -- well, I do wanna go last. Last is cool.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, everybody else has already gone. They've all gone. \[laughter\]

**Thomas Eckert:** How could you not go last...? \[laughs\]

**Jerod Santo:** You're first and then you're last.

**Thomas Eckert:** It can't take you anywhere.

**Adam Stacoviak:** What is it -- there was a book... A Little Blue Truck. "Move it, bud. I'm first. You're last." That's what it says.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Okay, fine. I'll -- default answer... I guess I'll pile on.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, he's piling on, after much --

**Adam Stacoviak:** I was thinking about having you read one of them at least, but I'm not going to do that.

**Jerod Santo:** \[01:28:09.29\] Well, let's start with the only guy who went his own way... Just like the old song, you can go your own way... But it's going to be a lonely day, Thomas. It's a lonely day. Sitting over there on Taylor's purposefully accelerating civilizational collapse. One point for Taylor.

**Thomas Eckert:** It had -- you already said accelerating. That's acceleration. You did it. You fully did it.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Accelerationism...

**Jerod Santo:** Accelerationism... \[laughs\] And then everybody else just piled on the "Marked by tremendous size", which is an adjective; even though Matthew was looking for nouns, he couldn't find one. It feels like a place... And that's because Brobdingnag is a place. It's a fictional place in Gulliver's Travels, where Gulliver goes, and the people in Brobdingnag are marked by tremendous size. And so they're Brobdingnagians. And so everybody who picked that gets two.

**Thomas Eckert:** I just think of like the Spiderman movie, when he lands in like the Netherlands, or something, and he says the name of the town... And it's like some -- I don't know what language they really speak there, but it reminds me of that word.

**Jerod Santo:** What language do they speak there?

**Thomas Eckert:** I don't know. What is the town name?

**Jerod Santo:** I have no idea what you're referring to.

**Thomas Eckert:** I'm going to get it. I'm going to get it.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. You think. A couple of shout-outs. Backyardigans - that was Adam. Golden Sun was Matthew. Does anybody know Golden Sun besides yourself, Matthew?

**Matthew Sanabria:** I know it, I played it. It was a good game.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay. And then of course, the Brobsledding was Thomas... Which was funny because somebody immediately thought Taylor wrote that one. But Taylor said it was too smart for him, or something.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm surprised no one chose the Brobbardigans. Or whatever they're called. What a shame.

**Jerod Santo:** Brobdingnagians?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Brobdingnagians, yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** So after six rounds of play, we do have winners... We also have hard stops, so we'll have to decide what we're going to do here, because --

**Adam Stacoviak:** People have won?

**Jerod Santo:** Taylor and Matthew both have 13 points, putting them over the 12-point threshold. David has 12, putting him at the 12-point threshold. So we can end the game with a two-way tie for first... I know that Thomas has to wrap. I think everybody has dinner to have at a certain point... We can call it, we can continue, we can go without Thomas, we can just...

**Thomas Eckert:** I'm not going to win this one, so... I can back out, go walk my dog...

**Jerod Santo:** Let's talk to our two guys tied for first place, Taylor and Matthew. How would you like to proceed?

**Matthew Sanabria:** I don't have a preference. We can tie it, we can tie-break it, we can... Whatever.

**Jerod Santo:** I have more rounds in my back pocket, so that's not a problem.

**Taylor Troesh:** Let me think. I am super-hungry... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Let's just call it a two-way tie for first...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, boy.

**Jerod Santo:** We've been playing a long time, so let's just congratulate our two winners.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Alright... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** I thought you were going to say something...

**Taylor Troesh:** Oh, yeah. Sorry. I think I lagged. I was going to say "Or we flip a coin", right? Flip a coin.

**Thomas Eckert:** I have an idea. You both see - go back and forth - who can name more words. And whoever runs out of words first loses. \[laughter\]

**Matthew Sanabria:** I would definitely lose that one easily...

**Adam Stacoviak:** It sounds like counting from one to a million.

**Taylor Troesh:** Yeah. One, two, three... You don't have another tiebreaker thing that we can do, Jerod?

**Jerod Santo:** I'm thinking...

**Matthew Sanabria:** You can do a live Google thing...

**Jerod Santo:** I do have another Goog round. We could just have the two of you --

**Matthew Sanabria:** Where we just guess... We both just like guess on three, or something... And whoever's guess is higher in the Google rank wins, or something.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[01:32:00.09\] On the fly.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, my goodness...

**Taylor Troesh:** Ask Google to generate a number between zero and one...

**Matthew Sanabria:** We could also do that.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, I'm pulling up Google right now...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Who's a Changelog++ subscriber...? No, I'm just kidding... \[laughter\]

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, yeah.

**Matthew Sanabria:** No, I'm just kidding.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay, so I'm going to pull up Google, I'm going to start typing in autocomplete, I'm going to stop... And then you guys will guess, until somebody hits the top autocomplete. And the person who hits it wins. You guys cool with that?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Sure.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, I have typed Bill Gates, space. Not Space Needle, but a literal blank character... Bill Gates, space. And the first one to hit it wins.

**Matthew Sanabria:** So how should we?

**Jerod Santo:** We'll start with the Changelog++ member, who's Matthew... \[laughs\]

**Matthew Sanabria:** But I'm not a Changelog++ member.

**Jerod Santo:** Oh, shoot. I thought you were.

**Matthew Sanabria:** I thought I was too, but... You know, I just listen so much.

**E. David Aja:** I am. I'll take it.

**Jerod Santo:** We'll start with Taylor. \[laughter\] I'm now offended by Matthew. I'll start with Taylor. Yeah, David is one... But he's also missing a point. Yeah, we'll start with Matthew. I'm not easily offended. Go ahead, man... It's better, though.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Alright, so just say one...?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, what do you think Bill Gates autocompletes to?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Net worth.

**Jerod Santo:** It's on there, but it's not number one.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Okay.

**Jerod Santo:** Taylor.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Feet.

**Taylor Troesh:** Is it Bill Gates versus Godzilla? That should probably be up in the top five. No, let's go with Bill Gates...

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's feet, man...

**Jerod Santo:** The blank's already in there.

**Taylor Troesh:** What keeps on coming up to me is like the Bill Gates Epstein situation, because there was a tie there, or something, and "Bill Gates Epstein" would be real topical maybe...

**Jerod Santo:** Okay... Okay, nope. Matthew? Good try.

**Matthew Sanabria:** What is Bill Gates even -- what is he known for now anymore? Or who cares to Google him?

**Jerod Santo:** He was in the news recently...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Was he in the news recently?

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah.

**Matthew Sanabria:** I don't care about Bill Gates...

**Jerod Santo:** I don't either. I just know he's in the news.

**Matthew Sanabria:** What does he do? Isn't he like involved in like farm stuff now?

**Adam Stacoviak:** He's bought a bunch of farmland.

**Matthew Sanabria:** That's what I thought.

**Jerod Santo:** David's chomping the bit, because he knows. He knows what this is about, and he's like "I was one point away. I could be in this."

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[unintelligible 01:34:21.20\] You're missing out.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Bill Gates' feet... I feel like if it's not net worth, I'd laugh if it was like the other one. What was the other Google one? I would laugh if it was the same thing, the same Google thing... You can put two names, right?

**Jerod Santo:** Steve Jobs' daughter.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Bill Gates' daughter. \[laughter\] Okay, I think I would guess... Isn't he a big proponent of like -- I don't even know.

**Jerod Santo:** Okay.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Give me a timer. Countdown something. It'll force something out of me.

**Jerod Santo:** Three, two, one...

**Matthew Sanabria:** Okay, climate change. Doesn't he do something with farms and climate change?

**Jerod Santo:** Bill Gates' climate change?

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah.

**Jerod Santo:** Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding...!

**Matthew Sanabria:** Is it really?

**Jerod Santo:** You got it, man. Bill Gates climate change. Matthew, pulling it out of nowhere... Is our winner. David knew that one...

**Matthew Sanabria:** My wife told me a bunch that he bought up a lot of farmland, and was trying to do these things...

**Jerod Santo:** He was in the news recently because he commented on climate change. I can't remember what he said, but it seems like he had softened his position, or he said it's not going to kill everybody, or something...

**E. David Aja:** We're just going to have to learn to live, mitigation, stuff like that.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Really?

**E. David Aja:** Yeah.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Oh, my God...

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, so people are googling it up.

**Matthew Sanabria:** That's wild.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. Well, it was a weird tiebreaker, but it was a tiebreaker nonetheless... And Taylor, I'm sorry, but Matthew just eked you out. David, was that what you were going to guess, was climate change, or did you have something else up your sleeve?

**E. David Aja:** The other thing that was relatively newsy about him recently would have been something about -- I think the last thing he said was something about how people can't expect his donations to step in for all the work the federal government isn't doing anymore...

**Jerod Santo:** Oh...

**E. David Aja:** So it would have been something about that. Or his foundation.

**Matthew Sanabria:** I wanted to say foundation. But if net worth wasn't there, I figured foundation wasn't going to be any higher...

**Taylor Troesh:** \[01:36:16.18\] Can I change my answer to Bill Gates' net worth? Can I do that?

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] Sure. On the Steve Jobs question, or are you on this one now?

**Thomas Eckert:** Can you read the ones that were there?

**Jerod Santo:** Bill Gates' climate change, number one. Bill Gates net worth, Bill Gates' climate change pivot, number three... Bill Gates' daughter... I don't even know, does he have a daughter? Bill Gates' daughter is number four...

**Matthew Sanabria:** That's hilarious.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah. And then you get into Bill Gates' age, Bill Gates' memo, climate change, Bill Gates' wife, and then you get down to Bill Gates quotes.

**Matthew Sanabria:** I feel like daughter and wife are always, no matter what --

**Jerod Santo:** I think people are just curious, like "Does this person have a daughter? Does this person have a wife?" Yeah.

**Taylor Troesh:** Dude, now I just need to grow my blog big enough where people are searching Taylor Troesh daughter, wife... You know? That's when you know you make it, you know?

**Thomas Eckert:** Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me pull up my Google thing now...
**Jerod Santo:** Oh, gosh...

**Thomas Eckert:** What are people saying...?
**Jerod Santo:** This is funny... The number one is Taylor Troesh, which I already typed, then Taylor Troesh LinkedIn, and then "Did Taylor and Taylor date?"

**Taylor Troesh:** Ooh, that's a good one.

**Jerod Santo:** And then Taylor Smith, Taylor history... So it's just moving -- yeah, it's just...

**Taylor Troesh:** How far is TaylorTown?

**Jerod Santo:** \[laughs\] That's a good question. Where is TaylorTown? Is it in Brobdingdang?

**Matthew Sanabria:** I don't get any autocompletes. I'm not famous.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, me either. Taylor's the coolest one.

**Adam Stacoviak:** So I have a confession to make...

**Jerod Santo:** What's that?

**Adam Stacoviak:** And I'm super-sad about it... I was -- you know when you play spades, or you've got really good cards, lik the wild card, when you're playing Uno, and you wait... And you're like "Oh, is this a good time to use my good thing?"

**Jerod Santo:** Right.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, I just waited too long. I never used the LLM. I'm so sad about that. I was going to use it when I thought I had a good score to get, at the very end, a trump card kind of thing... Yeah, sadly, I failed.

**Jerod Santo:** Well, we'll let you hold on to that for the next time you play.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I can get two next time. How about that? Two LLMs?

**Jerod Santo:** Sure. I'll give you two.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I like it.

**Jerod Santo:** I can't use them anyways.

**Taylor Troesh:** Does Matt get a free Changelog++ subscription for winning?

**Jerod Santo:** That's right... Yup.

**Adam Stacoviak:** We'll tell him where it's at, and then... That's free information.

**Jerod Santo:** It's at Changelog.com/++.

**Adam Stacoviak:** They say it's better.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright, y'all. Thanks for playing. This has been too much fun.

**Adam Stacoviak:** So much fun.

**Jerod Santo:** I feel like it was too competitive, almost too conservative because of the competition level... We've got to bring in some more loosey-goosey folks who are willing to guess the funny ones... But you all are invited back as well... And Matthew, the champion of champions. I mean, how does it feel?

**Matthew Sanabria:** I feel it with my hands, thanks. No, it feels good. We should definitely change the rules of pile-ons, though. It's easy to pile-on, so you're hedging your bets really well. It is a smart choice... So we should think about that.

**Jerod Santo:** Alright. We should think about fixing that. The problem is... Yeah, there needs to be more better answers, because then you'll pile on the wrong one, and I'll get some points. But so far --

**Matthew Sanabria:** Well, yeah. Like, the brobdingnigan-something... Like, it's not that I think it was the size, but every other answer was wrong. And then I was left between my answer and the right answer...

**Jerod Santo:** So it's really your guys' fault, is my point.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Yeah, it is our fault.

**E. David Aja:** We're insufficiently creative.

**Adam Stacoviak:** This one was actually tough to be more funny, too. I usually come up with more funny stuff, so listeners - I probably disappointed them a little bit... Except for the Backyardigans cousin version... That was pretty cool. I liked that one.

**Jerod Santo:** Yeah, that was funny.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I was waiting for you to read it, Jerod. I wanted to see your face.

**Jerod Santo:** Taylor played it way straighter than he normally does. I think he was really tying to win. Normally, his answers are just preposterous... But a lot of good answers coming out of Taylor.

**E. David Aja:** Yeah. The other way to sort of rebalance the game is to -- if everyone has to choose simultaneously the results... So you kind of submit them, essentially.

**Jerod Santo:** Right. So you don't get to actually hear their logic... Yeah, because Thomas was really picking it apart and giving all of his logic out early, and he actually did logic his way to the right answer... But then everyone's just like "Yeah, I'm going to go with that one." So yeah... Most people hold those thoughts inside and just guess, I think, but he was really explaining his thought... Which I appreciate, as a guy just listening... But you know, you guys apparently appreciate it as well.

**Matthew Sanabria:** He had some good definitions, too. He just repeated the words, like water-water, accelerate-accelerate...

**Jerod Santo:** By the way, to our listeners, Thomas has to bounce. That's why we're talking about him and not talking to him. It'd be weird if he was still here and we were just talking about him... It's kind of weird talking about him with him not here, but shout-out to Thomas... Excellently played round of \#define. And I thought everybody played well. Thanks for joining us, guys.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. Bye, friends.

**Jerod Santo:** Bye, Taylor, bye, Matthew, bye, David, bye, Thomas...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Bye me.

**Jerod Santo:** We'll see if we can get Carol to come up and kick all your guys' butts next time around.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Come on, Carol...

**Jerod Santo:** Get back over here, Carol... Carol Lee, PhD. Bye, y'all.

**Matthew Sanabria:** Bye!
