**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** I think we've said this before, that where attention goes, energy flows. So the more that I focus on something, I tend to feed that, and make that grow. It's interesting, because I think attention and focus is something that all of us struggle with in one way or another... And I think it was Aristotle who said the demise of the world will come through distraction. While many years ago Socrates and Aristotle debated this idea of distraction around it being a matter of the will, but they didn't have the same distractions we had...

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** You know, binge-watching Game of Thrones was not something they had to resist.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Good luck... Yes. Season eight though, however - that's a different story, season eight.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** \[laughs\] Season eight.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Seasons eight, that's all I'll say. Season eight. Everybody knows... But yes, so true. I mean, I don't watch The Bachelor or The Bachelorette; not because they're terrible TV shows or any sort of personal reasons, but I personally don't have a desire to watch them. However, I do.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Right.

**Adam Stacoviak:** My wife watches them, so I hang with my wife, and next thing you know, I'm enthralled in the drama or what's going on, and I wanna know "Why would she do that to him?" or "Why would he do that to her? Why did they like him?", or whatever the situation is. It's so easy to get distracted.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Right, but I would say that part of that is relative to this sense of curiosity. What's gonna happen?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. Completion.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Right? I even think of horror movies; we all know when watching horror movies, like "Don't. Go. There. Don't go behind, in the back garage!"

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right. The bad thing's there.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** But we're apt towards discovery, and being like "I'm just curious. I just wanna find out what happens."

**Adam Stacoviak:** What's terrible about that too is there's times where our curiosity pays off...

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Sure.

**Adam Stacoviak:** ...and there's times when our curiosity leads us down a road of distraction.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Yes.

**Adam Stacoviak:** And maybe finding a way to distinct those two is the key.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Well, and this is why -- we talk a lot with some things we know and more of the things that we don't know, or things that are generally true versus the specifics, which apply to an individual or the context of them and their situation... But attention as a construct or as a function of the brain is really critical, because it plays a role in so many things.

Attention, ironically, is actually a function of our brain; it is generally related to our prefrontal cortex, so that front part, your forehead, right behind there. The prefrontal cortex is part of the frontal lobe, which is related to this system of executive function. Executive function involves set shifting, how quickly we process information, problem-solving... And so if I don't consider what I'm placing my attention on, I might not also consider the domino effect that occurs from focusing in that way.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[00:04:20.04\] Yeah.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** I've talked about this phenomenologically, when you buy a new car, and then all of a sudden you go out and you drive and you go "There's one! And there's one! And there's another!" Right? And nothing really changed, other than your attention. And maybe I can even substitute the word awareness for attention...

**Adam Stacoviak:** I think awareness is a keyword, because 1) there's a book around it, and we can point to that; it's a great book. We've mentioned that one before. But definitely, what is in your awareness has got your attention. I can think of when I -- I don't like to do this, but every once in a while when I drive, I might look at my phone. And even before I do it, I have a precursor to say "Don't go too deep." But something very tantalizing will be on the device, and somehow distract me for a moment... And it could turn out to be a bad moment.

So that's why driving and looking at your phone could be really bad... Because it's got your full awareness, and you might be trying to drive... I use this as an example because it's so easy to get distracted, and that's the point I'm trying to make here - it's so easy for our awareness to (as you say) domino-effect into something else... Because if I'm trying to drive, or someone's trying to drive and their phone distracts them, or something around changing the radio station or changing the song, it's so easy to go from full awareness and full attention to driving safely, to wrecking, or not seeing the car in front of you stop, or whatever... And the loss of attention and the distraction process is so fast. It is milliseconds, and it happens just so fast.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Yeah, it does... And I love this; Kitty Chisholm - hopefully I didn't massacre her name, but she did this TEDx talk on attention, and she says it's a very competitive environment when it comes to attention. Attention is this mechanism through which the brain focuses its resources on some thing. And if you can direct your attention, then you can direct where your brain puts its resources.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I wanna say real quick that's why I love podcasting... Because podcasting -- listener, who's listening to my words right now, you opted into this. We didn't put a banner out there, we didn't put this flower out, we didn't email you... Well, we may have emailed you, because you opted into that, too... But the point is that somehow you're listening to this because you opted in. So you said to yourself, somewhere, in some shape or form, "I wanna place my attention to here, to this show called Brain Science" or to other shows we have, or other podcasts. The point is that it's very opt-in.

You've said before, Mireille, that when you can participate in your choices, it's so much easier to be involved and to be committed to those choices because you played a key role in that choice. That's why I love podcasting - you opted in. We didn't distract you to get you to listen to this. You're listening to this on your own accord, hopefully. Maybe a friend wrote to you and said "Hey, listen to this." But the point is that you opted in, and we're not stealing your attention. That's what this format is, it's not an attention-stealer.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Yeah, but even what you're talking about, Adam, I appreciate so much, because it's exactly what the old philosophers were talking about, in that it involves an aspect of the will. So I have options.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Right. When you have options... You have options. You have choices. What exactly is the will though? Because we talked about that being a finite resource...

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** \[00:08:02.13\] Right, it is, but it doesn't mean it can't grow, it can't change. And this is why I love talking about the brain and really doing what I do - neuroplasticity, so the brain's flexibility, willingness, ability to adapt is alive and real, and it doesn't matter what age you are. You can always change your brain. So willpower, again, as a resource to say "I've built it maybe over in this lane, because what I've done is allocate my resources, so that now it doesn't require as much for that habit, that skill, that practice... But over here in this new lane, now it requires greater resources for resistance."

So attention isn't a sort of one thing, it's multi-faceted. And I don't know how much we've talked about this, but it's really important to get that the brain is never as simple as we'd like it to be, and we're always discovering more... But we process information from the bottom up, so think brain stem up, to more of the neocortex, as well as top-down; so within that neocortex, back down. Because it's always interfacing.

Studies talk about bottom-up features of perception, which is this degree to which our sensory systems are taxed or loaded upon, and that influences how much attention we can devote to a task. Say for example -- I think about this, like my office staff, or anybody in admin, where phones are ringing perpetually... This sensory data you're taking in is...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Constant.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Yeah. And you have people coming up to the front window... So you're seeing things, you're hearing things, your senses are on overdrive, while you also then have to do other tasks, like writing things down... And it's not like all of the internal processing stops. So that's the other component when I talk about top-down, that can constrain attention or awareness. For example, these are our expectations, or other people's expectations - they can also shift our attention, sometimes in meaningful ways.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, a meaningful way might be suddenly I feel this sensation in my fingers. Oh, that sensation is fire. Suddenly, my full attention is now to the fact that I'm being burned. Or something -- I've put my hand on the stove, or made a mistake while cooking, whatever it is; I've got attention on the recipe, I'm thinking about swiping my iPad to get to the different ingredients or the specifics of how to make this meal, or whatever it might be, and suddenly my sensory -- as you were talking about your different sensory organisms... To say "Hey, hang on, you're actually on fire. You should probably stop everything, even though this meal is important. Your hand cannot be replaced... Easily." \[laughs\]

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** But see how that's evolutionarily adaptive? We need to be able to register sensory data live; it's happening in the moment, so that that takes precedence. That's why it's a bottom-up, so it comes to that brain stem, which our brains fundamentally -- the foundation of what our brains are always trying to do is keep us alive.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's so cool, honestly... "Just don't die." Every choice we make is about not dying.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Right. It's this competing system. So if I'm taking in information bottom-up, my senses tell me one thing - think VR - and then my higher cognitive functions tell me another thing, like "That's not real, even though your brain it's telling you is real." Oh gosh, now how do I respond, and which thing do I put greater attention on?

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[00:12:08.20\] Yes. That's a constant battle.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** It is, because attention really sort of blows things up, so that then colors all of what you see... I see this a lot in the work that I do, in just the way that people have been trained, so to speak, by their experience, to go "This is what I expect in relationship. Here's the way that people treat me." And I have to go "Hold on..." I recognize and I empathize that this is what it's been like for you, but is that always only ever true? Or is that what you've trained yourself to see, and/or is there a way in which you actually participate in that, because you believe or put your attention to see relationships or people that are going to interface with you in that way, and now you're stuck in the same cycle.

We can look at it with even any work things that you do. Say you always get stuck in this same place on a work project, or in a sport. "I always get to that final race, and then I just blow it, at the end."

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. The ten-yard line fail.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Right. So here we go, I can't talk about attention without talking about emotion... Because emotion is gonna create hiccups in and around what I can pay attention to. Because if I take in sensory data, that it's like, okay, I'm running a race, or I'm riding a bike, or I'm working on a project, and then my emotions are talking to me, or I have that negative internal dialogue, like we've talked about, that inner bully...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Now I've got this inner disruption in my attention, and going like "Oh, how do I do this task in front of me? ...like, live live, while I also have this chatter that's competing for my attention, that tells me what the outcome is already gonna be?"

**Adam Stacoviak:** And that's hard to -- and I don't even know how, so maybe you have some awareness of how to not let that be such an occurrence... Because as we've said before, emotion, curiosity - if we put those two in the same kind of bucket, there's times when following our intuition, our emotion, our gut or our curiosity, it pays off... And there's times when obviously it's gonna distract us in that ten-yard line blow it kind of moment; it's gonna happen, because you might have killed it the first 80 yards - to use a football analogy - and the last ten yards your emotion steps in and gets you distracted, and the next thing you know you \[unintelligible 00:14:49.28\] fumble, you lose the ball, whatever. You basically don't cross the goal.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Right.

**Adam Stacoviak:** There's time when those things pay off, and there's times when they don't. How do you discern that? Discernment is probably a key aspect to train.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** It is, it is. Imagine that you have to learn how to translate your own experience of fear.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** There's a lot of talk nowadays about fear and people struggling with anxiety, and I want our listeners to understand and recognize, fear is adaptive. The purpose is never to eliminate fear, because fear is a signal. It's just a feedback.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** But if I don't know how to interpret the signals that fear is sending me, I'm gonna struggle, because fear - it could be that it is an actual threat. I mean, it could be around a loss, or it could be an act of violence, it could be performance anxiety in that way... But how do you begin to be aware of your own internal system, that then creates the physiological response, which then competes for your attention, and then runs the dialogue as based on past experience, not present or future?

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[00:16:14.23\] We're still int his new year aspect; it's still January barely... And people are still transitioning to and determining their goals for the year, if that's what you do; not so much that it's a new year's thing, but just something that people tend to do because it's a new year, a new beginning, it's a new slate to build upon. And a way that you can use fear to your advantage is if your goals that you've set for the year don't scare you, in some way. You probably didn't push yourself or you're probably not pushing yourself as far hard as you could to -- not so much just for the sake of progress, but for the sake of the fact that it's a feedback of "If the goals that I've put before me don't give me some sort of fear, then I probably should push my goals a little further." And that's probably where I can say I personally use fear to my advantage.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Sure.

**Adam Stacoviak:** In the case where you just said, there's times when fear is an indicator, it's feedback, and to not minimize it or reduce it to nothing, but to use it to your advantage.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Yeah, I've heard this example in people within the martial arts field, and for the sake of my experience in conversation and awareness as a woman, not learning to trust intuition, which fear is a signal of something that has the potential for harm... And researchers and experts in that field will say the data is that 100% of the time people who have survived an attack of sorts had a feeling, had some sense of awareness that something was off before they were assaulted or attacked in some sort of way. And yet, we don't want to make other people feel uncomfortable or badly, and I might not have the rational data to support the feeling, so I'm apt to diminish that data point as having relevance.

Think, for example - they have this analogy of somebody pressing the emergency stop on the elevator. Say I'm in an elevator with only one other person, and they hit the emergency stop. Do you think that that is cause for my brain to signal alarm? Probably.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I would hope so, yeah. There's some reason.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Right. Because do people really have -- Adam, have you ever had an experience where someone has playfully hit the emergency stop button when you're in an elevator?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Um, no. No, honestly.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** I was gonna say, if you \[unintelligible 00:18:46.26\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's usually a purposeful action, usually...

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Right. And so if I shut down on that awareness, that signal my brain is giving me, I am now in further opportunity for harm because I'm not gonna react out of that perception of threat. So our conversation when it comes to attention isn't all around threat, but actually deciphering signals and recognizing more of attention as whether things are in the forefront or the background.

Another area in which I can talk about this is when people have chronic pain. Pain as an experience is really pervasive. It's always knocking on your door; you're aware, you hurt. Remember this hurt, don't do this.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Right...

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** But the pain - if you can learn how to move and maneuver it from the forefront of your mind to the background of your mind, so from the forefront of your attention to just in the background, it actually helps you navigate the pain differently and more adaptively.

That being said, it doesn't mean it's easy... Right? Hence binge-watching Game of Thrones.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It all comes back to Game of Thrones. Season eight...

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** There is this aspect of willpower involved with attention. So what if you could think of attention very much like your camera lens?

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[00:20:19.04\] Well, we've used that as an example before, the panoramic view versus the narrow view. This makes sense.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Selfie mode versus outward-mode.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** And going "Where is my attention?" Because if you can imagine, wherever you're placing that attention, I'm now blowing up the balloon bigger and bigger, so that I'm very much focused on that detail.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. Let me add one more to this then for you. So what if instead of saying "Where is my attention?" you can say "Where is my camera pointing?" And then the question after that might be "Which focal length am I at?" So you might have to dig into the camera aspects of this, to some degree... A 20 mm lens is very narrow, versus a very -- or sorry, 20 mm is very wide, or pretty wide, while 85 mm, what they use for portraits, is very narrow. You like that, because it sort of separates the background... So different lenses have very distinct, different vantage points to the camera itself. So just pointing it is one aspect, but the focal length of the lens is another.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Right, but do you see how it then creates a whole different experience because of what you're bringing into focus? And whether you see the close-up or the distant and all of the sort of images or outlines of the images, as opposed to all of the pixels of the person...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** And there's times we need both, right?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, that's why the new iPhone has three cameras.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Yeah...

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's a joke there, but it's true though, because -- I mean, why take one picture of one focal length, why not take a picture with all three, or three different, distinct focal lengths? Is that something that we can sort of adapt to us? Can we have many focal lengths at once?

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Sure.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That would be perception? That's how you narrow your focus and attention?

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Yeah, yeah. Think about this being able to push things out of awareness or into the background. It's like, I am just honing more of a certain image in my camera lens, so that I can see it more clearly.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. I like this analogy a lot. This idea of our awareness being a camera; where is it pointed, to which degree is our lens focused? What are we seeing in there? We've said this before, it's all data, and how can you take in this data to make wise choices? And if we can use fear to our advantage... As you've said, fear is an indicator, it's a feedback loop. We're always considering "How can we not die in this moment?" and there's some moments that are more threatful than others, obviously... You know, when you're being physically attacked, that's way different than just simply poking your finger with a needle, or stubbing your toe, or something like that. There are different pain or fear receptors that happen because of that.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Sure.

**Adam Stacoviak:** But the point is that to not die today means to leverage your fear, to make wise choices, to focus your attention to therefore hit some sort of optimization of what you're trying to do in your life.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Yeah. And I don't wanna divert too far away from this, but I can't help but braid in also the concept of vulnerability. Because if we're talking about fear and not dying, it might not be that there's an imminent threat to my physical body, but rather in creative endeavors.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. My creativity, my ego, my brand... Personal brand even.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Who people think I am.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Right. And I think people encounter this vulnerability in a myriad of ways in different jobs. Authors, writing books.

**Adam Stacoviak:** They're very vulnerable, yeah.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** \[00:24:14.00\] Correct. Even when you write a program. Whenever you sort of use yourself as the frame of reference to then offer something to the world, without a guaranteed outcome around how others are gonna receive it - now I'm vulnerable, now I'm anxious, and now I'm like "Am I really thinking with my whole brain, or am I just thinking like a reptile, and I'm just like fight, flight or freeze?" Do I go hide out under my turtle shell, or do I puff up and try to...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Attack.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Yeah.

**Adam Stacoviak:** So why do you think vulnerability plays into attention? Why is it important to -- I guess if we can say "If fear is a feedback, is vulnerability a feedback?"

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** It is. I would say that that's part of it, because having the awareness of whatever I'm doing involves a certain amount of vulnerability. Then I'm switching over to a matter of the will, and asking myself "Is it worth it to recognize that I'm going to potentially lose, or be rejected, or have other people say criticisms of the work I've done?", when I am vulnerable.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** And remember, when we are talking about these things, I'm never talking about it as a binary construct, like it's all or nothing, black or white... But rather, vulnerability is a continuum; attention, even as a continuum... That you can focus your camera lens in different ways along a continuum, like super close-up, or way zoomed out.

So coming back around to that attention, there is what we talk about or describe as divided attention, like literally I'm attending to two separate things simultaneously. Think about it like taking notes when you're in college, or you're listening to a lecture. You're listening, so you're taking it in through your auditory senses, but then I'm also transmitting the information and utilizing other cognitive resources to be able to manipulate the information and write it down. So I'm doing two things simultaneously. That's this divided attention.

But then there's also sustained attention. So it's literally like one track, one way; there's no two-ways streets. I'm on a one-way road, and this is all I'm focused on.

**Break:** \[00:26:45.03\] to \[00:26:45.12\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** So these two aspects of attention - you've got divided, you've got sustained... I think about flow. Years ago I did a podcast with a woman named Kathy Sierra, very famous in the software world. She exposed me to user experience and this aspect to the brain that's cognitive awareness, so to speak... And she had talked about the state of flow, and I had no idea about it. I read some books obviously since then about it, but it's sort of borderlining on these two things where you have divided or sustained attention, and the benefits that can come from being in a state of flow, which a lot of our listeners are gonna be pretty familiar with, but... Very interesting and deep subject.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Yeah, flow is a very interesting concept, and it gets at the heart of the sustained attention, although there's more to it... And that flow is very much the epitome of mindfulness, like I'm fully absorbed in the moment I'm in. Some people would reference flow very much like the concept of play, and for play as a construct, it's qualified by two things. One is that I don't want it to end, and two, that I lose track of time. Hence, it's a deep dive. I am all-in whatever I'm doing.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[00:28:13.11\] That's why they encourage some work -- I'm not sure how to phrase it, but essentially making work playful. Because you get lost. You find a kid deep in a pretend mode, their play mode, whatever it is - it's gonna be very difficult to get their attention. My son - he's playing, and I'm like "Eli, Eli", and I'm trying to get his attention, for whatever reason... It hits hard to sort of like -- it's almost like zapping them out of something. You almost have to do something significant to get their attention. And they even almost sort of shake themselves awake... And I'm using this as a metaphor, obviously, for this, but that's what it reminds me of.

When we're in flow, it's like tunnel vision, deep, deep, deep, and some really amazing things can come from that... Whether it's a child play, or using that in a work-related aspect, whether it's an artist, a podcaster, a software developer, whatever it might be, to use this data flow to their advantage.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** It is. Years ago I actually had that opportunity when I was in graduate school, to do what we referred to as bio-feedback, or neurofeedback. You put electrodes on someone's head in certain places, and then ironically, that's like the video game controller for a computer screen. So based on whatever thoughts they're thinking, it controls their moves or maneuver whatever it is on the screen. So it's like practicing their brain getting in a gear for this optimal functioning, which is sort of the calmer state... Like, I'm just in that zone.

So it's very much in sports, athletic performance, of like I'm using these data waves, these brain waves that are not asleep, but not super high awake waves, and that's why it's very different as a construct and an experience... Because you're just kicking on all cylinders, except not at that high rate. Does that make sense?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Kind of. When you said theta waves, is that like a sound wave, or is that a brain wave?

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** It's brain waves. So there's brain waves. So there's alpha, theta, beta waves for our brain. Theta waves are just the one that comes up to being more in the forefront when people are in this state of flow. If you can think of it, it's just like a gear; I get in that gear. So we can train ourselves around this, which is why I'm so glad you brought this up... Because I always want our listeners to know what they can do, not just "Here's some information..."

**Adam Stacoviak:** The science behind it, yeah... Apply it.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Yeah. And so figuring out when you're in that place... Do you even know, Adam, times at which you felt at your peak performance, where imagine everything else fades into the background for your awareness, and you're just honed in on a project?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes. Yeah, I am very aware of that. And I'm even more aware when I don't achieve it, which is terrible... But I think what I try to do is I try to optimize my life for serving up that opportunity.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Sure.

**Adam Stacoviak:** So determining what it is that allows me to have a distraction-free scenario for a sustained amount of time, in order to hit these peak performance flow states. Most of what I do -- I think pretty much anybody who desires to be productive is like "How can I optimize for those environments?" And when we're trying to define our day and design our work life, the work time of our life -- for me, I've mentioned before, work eight/play eight/sleep eight. So when I define my eight, how can optimize those eight, to have as much of that as possible?

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** \[00:32:06.11\] Yeah. So am I correct if what you're saying is you are aware that there's certain elements that you utilize in order to impose constraints around you and the time you spend in the type of work that you're doing?

**Adam Stacoviak:** You are correct.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Yeah. And so there's deliberate efforts.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes. Thoughtfulness. Purposeful.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Yeah. I once upon a time had a boss who used to tape a sign to his door that said "In Barbados."

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[laughs\] That's awesome. Yes... I'm gonna get that for my door. Or I'll go to Jamaica instead... But Barbados - sure.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** But that was an indicator - unless the office was burning down...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Don't talk to me.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Yeah. You don't interrupt me. I need to get this thing done. So I need to have all of my attention focused on this one thing, so that I can do my best, or feel like I've accomplished the task before me.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, let me just say that the sign is one layer of protection for this...

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Sure.

**Adam Stacoviak:** ...you know, to use this example, your boss, or your previous boss, or whatever the scenario was... But you still have yourself. Oh my gosh, put your phone away... This is me talking to me, not me talking to you, audience... But I am my worst final barrier to the state of flow, because I have to have the discipline of pushing these things away which distract me... Because the sign will help other people outside the door from coming in, but it won't stop the things that are already in, like digital things, that can be distracting.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Sure, sure. So that's just it - when we're talking about attention, there's external intrusions...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Right.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** The phone ringing, other people interrupting us... But there's also internal distractions, that are sort of like "Oh yeah, what was that? Shoot, I needed to make sure I get the laundry done... What was the grocery list, before I do that? Oh, and what else do we have this weekend?" The litany of other--

**Adam Stacoviak:** The internal chatter of life...

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Yeah. And then we now have this phone that's such an easy distraction. I forget where I was reading this, but somebody said the average person - and I don't know what constitutes person or how that's defined - 2,617 is how often a person picks up a phone within a day.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, yeah...

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Right?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. I so bad wanna go on a phone fast... A 30-day -- I don't know if I could do it, or how would I change because of it... But I see people out there saying "I did a 30-day fast from my smartphone, or from X social media account" or whatever it is. I wanna see how that works, because -- the phone is one part, because it's both helpful and hurtful.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Yes.

**Adam Stacoviak:** There's so many things about it that are positives, because -- indicators, feedback, getting a text from my wife saying "The house is on fire" or "Quick, come here. I need you, because we have a newborn." I need to still have that kind of attachment to the external world. So the phone is both helpful and hurtful. So how can I balance that?

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** So part of it is knowing yourself and what you're most prone to do. I think about it -- I write a lot of reports, and sometimes... Well, I just have a lot of writing to do... Always. \[laughs\] So I'm always tempted, like, that's my time to shop online. So I will actually disconnect the Wi-Fi or go to somewhere where I know I don't have Wi-Fi...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, wow.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** \[00:36:08.11\] So I impose other constraints in order to be able to do it. Also, other things that I do - tethering this in distraction plus flow, I will play certain music as based on whatever activity I'm trying to cultivate, or get done.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Right. Yeah, I actually play some -- that's why I asked you if it was audio waves earlier, because I listen to some theta waves stuff when I'm working. They call it white noise, pink noise... There's different types of noise, but essentially it's -- in some cases, like in banks, for example, they will play certain sounds that reduces the audibility of words. So you may be ten feet away from the teller, but not be able to hear that person communicate personal feedback to the person two feet away from them; you're ten feet away. So it disrupts the audibility of words by distance.

The same, it might influence a state of flow or a state of internal hum. I don't know the science behind it, but all I know is there are theta waves, there are these kinds of waves, and stuff like that, and there's different hertz that the sound may be in, and it may attract... What do you know about those things? Is that something you use?

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** What, for the different hertz?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Well, just that auditory thing. I like your aspect of the intentionality of disconnecting the Wi-Fi. The same is me turning on a certain soundtrack

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Yeah, part of it is -- what I'm trying to do with attention is sort of impose other constraints. I mean, very much like all the different dishes we can use for cooking, and going "What is the form that I want whatever dish to have when it's done? Do I want muffins? Do I want bread? Do I want it on a sheet tray?" So how can I impose constraints that make me more prone, ironically, that I'm relying less on my will and more on the demand of that environment? ...hence why it can be challenging to work from home, because there's less buffering, so to speak, from both internal and external distractions or disruptions.

So you have the bonus, you don't have to leave your home, but then how does your brain calibrate around "No, this is where I'm working." I think that's why it's so important that people, when they work remotely, do have a designated workspace, because it cues your brain -- remember, we talked about habits... Our environment is a key catalyst with running whatever play.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right, yeah. If you're in your office or in a particular place where you do the work, that's where the work gets done. And I try - that's what I do in my own home, is that I have a designated space where I do work, and so when I'm there... Anybody, even my kids, they know - when dad's in there, he's working. Or supposedly working, if I'm not distracted, right? But if I'm being vulnerable with the audience and myself here in this moment - which is a good thing - is that when I'm in this place here, it's work mode. Don't put a workout machine, don't put a Peloton in your office. Sure, you probably could, and if you have the willpower and discipline, maybe that works for you... But sometimes mixing exercise with work, you get this guilt or this shame that comes from not doing one or the other, and you sort of mix environments.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Right. Like, what if we did a poll? Because think about this relative to whether or not couples have TVs in their bedrooms...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. Well, many functional medicine doctors that I follow will say "Do not put a TV in your bedroom." Guess where we have a TV.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** \[00:40:06.05\] \[laughs\] Right. But it's going "Do I need those constraints, or am I able to manage it?" What's hard for me isn't necessarily hard for someone else, which may be semi-hard for another person. It really just comes back to building skills alongside this awareness.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** And I think for people to recognize, just like we actually will cast a body part for a period of time, it creates less mobility, so that healing can take place. That's the same thing we can do when we're trying to change ourselves; it's going "Is there a way in which I can impose further constraints, so that healing or strength can be built in this area, so that when I remove the cast, I then can use it differently?"

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** But what about distractions as being good?

**Adam Stacoviak:** Hm... When has a distraction been good for me? Well, I suppose I don't like to do -- not so much give blood, but what is it whenever you go and you get lab work done? I guess it's give blood, but it's not give blood for the sake of --

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Well, no, it's lab work.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It's not donating your blood, I mean, but you're still giving your blood to the cause of labs, you know what I mean? I don't like that. I'm a tough person; I don't particularly like a needle, an IV going into my body. I don't like to look at it. It's not gonna make me faint, I'm not a weenie because of it, or whatever it is... I just don't particularly like it. So for me, I use a distraction in those moments to help me take my attention off of the thing that is like the elephant in the room, giving my blood for this lab cause.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Oh, so you mean you use distraction to manage painful or negative emotions.

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right. I do that.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Right. And I'm still with you. I just don't like the prick, so I minimize my attention, and all I do is I look away while they do the initial prick. And then I'm fine.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. They usually use my left arm, and I'm looking right. And they're so quick with it too, thankfully...

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** I know.

**Adam Stacoviak:** They really are. And it's very painless these days. I mean, there's nothing painful about it, it's just I don't like it. I'd prefer not to pay attention to it... So I cue up some distractions.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Right. I do want to sort of clarify, when we're talking about these distractions as being good, that people have more of the concept of them. Daniel Goleman, which I'm not sure if you're familiar with him, but he wrote Emotional Intelligence...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yes.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** And he's now got the book Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence... Ironically. So he talks about sensory distractions and emotional distractions. Sensory distractions as being things happening around you, i.e. that sort of bottom-up processing, what you're taking in from the outside in... As opposed to emotional distractions, which is your inner dialogue, thoughts about things happening in your life; so think more top-down processing.

So when we use distractions to help us, or very much in this case of managing more of the emotional distractions, and going "I don't want to hear the chatter that my brain is telling me around whatever situation or feeling that I have..." So now I'm going to go "Whoop!" and I'm going to pivot my attention, just like you turned your head in doing the lab work...

**Adam Stacoviak:** That's right.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** \[00:43:45.13\] ...so that I am not focused on that thing that feels aversive to me. And I think this is so much at the heart of change, when people realize "Oh, you mean I don't have to just wallow in the feeling?" No. No, change it. Change the channel of what you're focusing on. So imagine then I've got sort of this divided attention. I'm aware that I'm being poked, but my attention is also attuned to music, or something else that's positive, that feels good. I'm in the Bahamas on a beach.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Right. Barbados.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Yes, yes. So apart from the negative emotions that we all encounter, the other time that distraction is actually sometimes helpful is with falling asleep.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh, yes. I use very often -- and I'm actually not sure if it's a good thing, having done it for so long. I almost have to be distracted to fall asleep.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Well, tell me what you do.

**Adam Stacoviak:** No. I don't wanna tell you.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** \[laughs\]

**Adam Stacoviak:** I'm just kidding. I'll tell you. Mostly it's listening to usually a conversation or a book on a deep subject. If it's something that's stimulating, that really catches my attention, it's hard. So it's a two-way sword. Sometimes I really enjoy listening to books on physics. Different astrophysics, or deep thinking type stuff. Sometimes it's good because it's so deep; I can't follow it and I get distracted and fall asleep because of it. Or my attention gets piqued and the next thing you know I'm wired.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** And this is exactly why I asked you, because you just nailed both sides of how it can be helpful and how it can be harmful in that context. You don't want the arousal to be the attention, so to speak (when I talk about arousal) that your attention gets piqued to the degree that you're like "I'm not gonna go to sleep now, because I wanna hear the end, or what they're gonna say..." But rather, it is enough of a distraction, clearing or minimizing the chatter in my own mind, that it's like that humdrum, that your brain's like "Aaand we can fade away, and go to sleep..."

**Adam Stacoviak:** This might be a deeper subject, so let's maybe pin this one for a future topic, because it is pretty deep... But I'll just say four letters: ASMR.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** ASMR.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Have you heard of this ASMR?

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** No.

**Adam Stacoviak:** \[00:46:16.20\] It's Auditory Sensory... MR. I don't know what the MR stands for. But it's essentially people -- it's huge; it's huge in this distraction to fall asleep scenario. ASMR essentially is some sort of audio sensory thing that you can listen to, that's like maybe crackling of tinfoil, or different sensories, or like fingernails or a microphone, or something like that. These are really things that people listen to, and they get really unique and deep. Some are very out there, and some are very benign and normal... But essentially, it's sounds that you wouldn't typically hear, that provide this distractive state...

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** So that you can fall asleep.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah. Or relax.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Oh, okay.

**Adam Stacoviak:** It could be a sensory deprivation tank where you're doing zero sensory, or some of that sensory... Essentially, it's a relaxful state sometimes to sleep.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Well, this is why I love these conversations, because they always promote further conversations, and this sense of discovery. I know there's a lot I wanna dive into around sleep, because we've referenced it briefly in other episodes... But a lot of people struggle with it, and part of it has to do with where we're placing our attention. I mean, you've heard people count sheep...

**Adam Stacoviak:** Yeah, exactly.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** Or ironically, count backward in sets of threes, from 100.

**Adam Stacoviak:** Oh yeah, because you've gotta really think about that, and then your brain gets distracted, and it's like, "What was that, three or four...?" and you just fall asleep. \[laughter\] It's funny.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** It is.

**Adam Stacoviak:** I've done that before, too.

**Mireille B. Reece, Psy.D:** It is. So for people to recognize -- I want people to begin to practice and to experiment how might you go about it this week, and go "What am I putting my attention on?" What does that feel like to me? Do I like it? Is it aversive and I'm like "Oh no, I need to change that channel in my mind"? Or "I can stay here for a while." But recognizing that there's this perpetual interplay between the inside and the outside, and that if we don't practice even discovering within ourselves how those factors interplay, we're apt to struggle all the more throughout our day-to-day lives.

So maybe consider how you might focus on something at the outset of your day, to go "This is where I'm gonna focus." You could say "I'm gonna focus on looking for tulips" or "I wanna find red cars", or "I wanna find the number three." Make it a playful exercise, so that you can begin to see the power of your own attention and how that acts as the steering wheel for your life.
